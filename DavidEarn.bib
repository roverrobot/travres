   Title = {Understanding the role of contextual influences on local health-care decision making: case study results from Ontario, Canada},
   Journal = {Social Science and Medicine},
   Volume = {53},
   Number = {6},
   Pages = {777-793},
   Abstract = {Approaches to involving the public in local health care decision making processes (and analyses of these approaches) have tended to treat participation and publics uniformly in search of the ideal method of involving the public or providing the same opportunities for public participation regardless of differing socio-economic, cultural, insitutional or political contexts within which decisions are made. Less attention has been given to the potential for various contextual factors to influence both the methods employed and the outcomes of such community decision-making processes. The paper explores the role that context (three sets of contextual influences more specifically) plays in shaping community decision-making processes. Results from case studies of public participation in local health-care decision making in four geographic communities in Ontario are presented. During the study period, two of these communities were actively involved in health services restructuring processes while one had recently completed its process and the fourth had not yet engaged in one. Several themes emerge from the case studies regarding the identification and role of contextual influences in differentially shaping participation in local health care decision-making. These include the propensity for communities with different social and structural attributes to engage in different "styles" of participation; the importance attached to "community values" in shaping both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of participation; the role of health councils, local government and inter-organizational collaboration as participation "enablers"; and the politicization of participation that occurs around contentious issues such as hospital closures.

   Volume = {16},
   Number = {1},
   Pages = {21-37},
   Abstract = {Arrays of identical limit-cycle oscillators have been used to model a wide variety of pattern-forming systems, such as neural networks, convecting fluids, laser arrays and coupled biochemical oscillators. These systems are known to exhibit rich collective behavior, from synchrony and traveling waves to spatiotemporal chaos and incoherence. Recently, Kuramoto and his colleagues reported a strange new mode of organization-here called the chimera state-in which coherence and incoherence exist side by side in the same system of oscillators. Such states have never been seen in systems with either local or global coupling; they are apparently peculiar to the intermediate case of nonlocal coupling. Here we give an exact solution for the chimera state, for a one-dimensional ring of phase oscillators coupled nonlocally by a cosine kernel. The analysis reveals that the chimera is born in a continuous bifurcation from a spatially modulated drift state, and dies in a saddle-node collision with an unstable version of itself.},

   Abstract = {This book provides a clear exposition of the flourishing field of fixed point theory, an important tool in the fields of differential equations and functional equations, among others. Starting from the basics of Banach’s contraction theorem, most of the main results and techniques are developed: fixed point results are established for several classes of maps and the three main approaches to establishing continuation principles are presented. The theory is applied to many areas of current interest in analysis, with topological considerations playing a crucial role, including a final chapter on the relationship with degree theory. Researchers and graduate students in applicable analysis will find this to be a useful survey of the fundamental principles of the subject. The very extensive bibliography and close to 100 exercises mean that it can be used both as a text and as a comprehensive reference work, currently the only one of its type.},

It has been created in order to unify the study of differential and difference equations. In this paper we give an introduction to the time scales calculus. We also present various properties of the exponential function on an arbitrary time scale, and use it to solve linear dynamic equations of first order. Several examples and applications, among them an insect population model, are considered. We then use the exponential function to define hyperbolic and trigonometric functions and use those to solve linear dynamic equations of second order with constant coefficients. Finally, we consider self-adjoint equations and, more generally, so-called symplectic systems, and present several results on the positivity of quadratic functionals.},

   Abstract = {A large influenza epidemic took place in Havana during the winter of 1988. The epidemiologic surveillance unit of the Pedro Kouri Institute of Tropical Medicine detected the begining of the epidemic wave. The Rvachev-Baroyan mathematical model of the geographic spread of an epidemic was used to forecast this epidemic under routine conditions of the public health system. The expected number of individuals who would attend outpatient services, because of influenza-like illness, was calculated and communicated to the health authorities within enough time to permit the introduction of available control measures. The approximate date of the epidemic peak, the daily expected number of individuals attending medical services, and the approximate time of the end of the epidemic wave were estimated. The prediction error was 12%. The model was sufficienty accurate to warrant its use as a practical forecasting tool in the Cuban public health system.},

There is abundant experimental evidence suggesting that fever leads to, or exacerbates, neuronal injury in conditions such as cerebral ischemia and traumatic brain injury. However, conclusive evidence linking control of fever to improved outcomes is lacking. It has been difficult to design studies looking at the impact of fever control on outcome, in part because traditional methods of fever control are ineffective. Recently, several new devices to control temperature have become available. These devices appear to be more effective than conventional means and might allow us to design studies that definitively answer the question: "Does controlling fever improve outcome?"},

Results are presented along with a comparison with epidemiological surveillance data which subsequently became available. Simulated epidemics were fitted to the estimated number of influenza-like syndromes collected within the Italian sentinel surveillance systems and showed good agreement with the timing of the observed epidemic. On the basis of the model predictions, we estimated the underreporting factor of the influenza surveillance system to be in the range 3.3–3.7 depending on the scenario considered. Model prediction suggested that the epidemic would peak in early November. These predictions have proved to be a valuable support for public health policy-makers in planning interventions for mitigating the spread of the pandemic.},

   Abstract = {The history of the development of statistical hypothesis testing in time series analysis is reviewed  briefly and it is pointed out that the hypothesis testing procedure is not adequately defined as the procedure for statistical model  identification. The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identifica- 
tion is introduced. When there are several competing  models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by 

AIC = (-2)log(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently  adjusted  parameters within the model). 

MAICE provides  a  versatile  procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities  inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time  series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples. },

   Volume = {19},
   Number = {1},
   Pages = {197-225},
   Abstract = {Influenza is a highly contagious, acute illness which has afflicted humans and animals since ancient times. Influenza viruses are part of the Orthomyxoviridae family and are grouped into types A, B
                       and C according to antigenic characteristics of the core proteins. Influenza A viruses infect a large variety of animal species, including humans, pigs, horses, sea mammals and birds, occasionally
                       producing devastating pandemics in humans, such as in 1918, when over twenty million deaths occurred world-wide. The two surface glycoproteins of the virus, haemagglutinin (HA) and
                       neuraminidase (NA), are the most important antigens for inducing protective immunity in the host and therefore show the greatest variation. For influenza A viruses, fifteen antigenically distinct HA
                       subtypes and nine NA subtypes are recognised at present; a virus possesses one HA and one NA subtype, apparently in any combination. Although viruses of relatively few subtype combinations
                       have been isolated from mammalian species, all subtypes, in most combinations, have been isolated from birds. In the 20th Century, the sudden emergence of antigenically different strains in humans,
                       termed antigenic shift, has occurred on four occasions, as follows, in 1918 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), 1968 (H3N2) and 1977 (H1N1), each resulting in a pandemic. Frequent epidemics have
                       occurred between the pandemics as a result of gradual antigenic change in the prevalent virus, termed antigenic drift. Currently, epidemics occur throughout the world in the human population due to
                       infection with influenza A viruses of subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 or with influenza B virus. The impact of these epidemics is most effectively measured by monitoring excess mortality due to
                       pneumonia and influenza. Phylogenetic studies suggest that aquatic birds could be the source of all influenza A viruses in other species. Human pandemic strains are thought to have emerged through
                       one of the following three mechanisms: genetic reassortment (occurring as a result of the segmented genome of the virus) of avian and human influenza A viruses infecting the same host direct transfer
                       of whole virus from another species the re-emergence of a virus which may have caused an epidemic many years earlier. Since 1996, the viruses H7N7, H5N1 and H9N2 have been transmitted
                       from birds to humans but have apparently failed to spread in the human population. Such incidents are rare, but transmission between humans and other animals has also been demonstrated. This has
                       led to the suggestion that the proposed reassortment of human and avian viruses occurs in an intermediate animal with subsequent transference to the human population. Pigs have been considered
                       the leading contender for the role of intermediary because these animals may serve as hosts for productive infections of both avian and human viruses and, in addition, the evidence strongly suggests
                       that pigs have been involved in interspecies transmission of influenza viruses, particularly the spread of H1N1 viruses to humans. Global surveillance of influenza is maintained by a network of
                       laboratories sponsored by the World Health Organization. The main control measure for influenza in human populations is immunoprophylaxis, aimed at the epidemics occurring between pandemics.},

In this report, we show that it cannot.
A lower bound was also presented by Fich (1981, 1983) for algorithms which have two memory locations and which make a finite number of `back advances'.  We show here that the same lower bound holds even if the restriction on back advances is dropped.},

In the case of a single infectious group, if R-0 > 1 and i infectious individuals are introduced into a susceptible population, then the probability of a major outbreak is approximately 1 - (1/R-0)(i). With multiple infectious groups from which the disease could emerge, this result no longer holds. Stochastic thresholds for multiple groups depend on the number of individuals within each group, i(j), j = 1,...,n, and on the probability of disease extinction for each group, q(j). It follows from multitype branching processes that the probability of a major outbreak is approximately 1 - q(1)(i1) ... q(n)(in). In this investigation, we summarize some of the deterministic and stochastic threshold theory, illustrate how to calculate the stochastic thresholds, and derive some new relationships between the deterministic and stochastic thresholds.},

   Abstract = {The role of stochasticity and its interplay with nonlinearity are central current issues in studies of the complex population patterns observed in nature, including the pronounced oscillations of wildlife and infectious diseases. The dynamics of childhood diseases have provided influential case studies to develop and test mathematical models with practical application to epidemiology, but are also of general relevance to the central question of whether simple nonlinear systems can explain and predict the complex temporal and spatial patterns observed in nature outside laboratory conditions. Here, we present a stochastic theory for the major dynamical transitions in epidemics from regular to irregular cycles, which relies on the discrete nature of disease transmission and low spatial coupling. The full spectrum of stochastic fluctuations is derived analytically to show how the amplification of noise varies across these transitions. The changes in noise amplification and coherence appear robust to seasonal forcing, questioning the role of seasonality and its interplay with deterministic components of epidemiological models. Childhood diseases are shown to fall into regions of parameter space of high noise amplification. This type of ‘endogenous’ stochastic resonance may be relevant to population oscillations in nonlinear ecological systems in general.},

   Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Universal health care systems seek to ensure access to care on the basis of need rather than income and to improve the health status of all citizens. We examined the performance of the Canadian health system with respect to these goals in the province of Ontario by assessing the effects of neighborhood income on access to invasive cardiac procedures and on mortality one year after acute myocardial infarction. METHODS: We linked claims for payment for physicians' services, hospital-discharge abstracts, and vital-status data for all patients with acute myocardial infarction who were admitted to hospitals in Ontario between April 1994 and March 1997. Patients' income levels were imputed from the median incomes of their residential neighborhoods as determined in Canada's 1996 census. We determined rates of use and waiting times for coronary angiography and revascularization procedures after the index admission for acute myocardial infarction and determined death rates at one year. In multivariate analyses, we controlled for the patient's age, sex, and severity of disease; the specialty of the attending physician; the volume of cases, teaching status, and on-site facilities for cardiac procedures at the admitting hospital; and the geographic proximity of the admitting hospital to tertiary care centers. RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 51,591 patients. With respect to coronary angiography, increases in neighborhood income from the lowest to the highest quintile were associated with a 23 percent increase in rates of use and a 45 percent decrease in waiting times. There was a strong inverse relation between income and mortality at one year (P<0.001). Each $10,000 increase in the neighborhood median income was associated with a 10 percent reduction in the risk of death within one year (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.90; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.94). CONCLUSIONS: In the province of Ontario, despite Canada's universal health care system, socioeconomic status had pronounced effects on access to specialized cardiac services as well as on mortality one year after acute myocardial infarction.},

   Journal = {Ecology Letters},
   Volume = {9},
   Pages = {467-484},
   Abstract = {Seasonal variations in temperature, rainfall and resource availability are ubiquitous and 
can exert strong pressures on population dynamics. Infectious diseases provide some of 
the best-studied examples of the role of seasonality in shaping population ﬂuctuations. 
In this paper, we review examples from human and wildlife disease systems to illustrate 
the challenges inherent in understanding the mechanisms and impacts of seasonal 
environmental drivers. Empirical evidence points to several biologically distinct 
mechanisms by which seasonality can impact host–pathogen interactions, including 
seasonal changes in host social behaviour and contact rates, variation in encounters with 
infective stages in the environment, annual pulses of host births and deaths and changes 
in host immune defences. Mathematical models and ﬁeld observations show that the 
strength and mechanisms of seasonality can alter the spread and persistence of infectious 
diseases, and that population-level responses can range from simple annual cycles to 
more complex multiyear ﬂuctuations. From an applied perspective, understanding the 
timing and causes of seasonality offers important insights into how parasite–host 
systems operate, how and when parasite control measures should be applied, and how 
disease risks will respond to anthropogenic climate change and altered patterns of 
seasonality. Finally, by focusing on well-studied examples of infectious diseases, we hope 
to highlight general insights that are relevant to other ecological interactions. },

One may think that a species under an external threat may survive in some isolated locations leading to the revival of the species. Using a general model we show that, under a common external forcing, the species with a quadratic saturation term first undergoes spatial synchronization and then extinction. The effect can be observed even when the external forcing acts only on some locations provided the dynamics contains a synchronizing term. Absence of the quadratic saturation term can help the species to avoid extinction.},

   Volume = {288},
   Number = {3},
   Pages = {242-283},
   Abstract = {RNA folding from sequences into secondary structures is a simple yet powerful, biophysically grounded model of a genotype–phenotype map in which concepts like plasticity, evolvability, epistasis, and modularity can not only be precisely defined and statistically measured but also reveal simultaneous and profoundly non-independent effects of natural selection. Molecular plasticity is viewed here as the capacity of an RNA sequence to assume a variety of energetically favorable shapes by equilibrating among them at constant temperature. Through simulations based on experimental designs, we study the dynamics of a population of RNA molecules that evolve toward a predefined target shape in a constant environment. Each shape in the plastic repertoire of a sequence contributes to the overall fitness of the sequence in proportion to the time the sequence spends in that shape. Plasticity is costly, since the more shapes a sequence can assume, the less time it spends in any one of them. Unsurprisingly, selection leads to a reduction of plasticity (environmental canalization). The most striking observation, however, is the simultaneous slow-down and eventual halting of the evolutionary process. The reduction of plasticity entails genetic canalization, that is, a dramatic loss of variability (and hence a loss of evolvability) to the point of lock-in. The causal bridge between environmental canalization and genetic canalization is provided by a correlation between the set of shapes in the plastic repertoire of a sequence and the set of dominant (minimum free energy) shapes in its genetic neighborhood. This statistical property of the RNA genotype–phenotype map, which we call plastogenetic congruence, traps populations in regions where most genetic variation is phenotypically neutral. We call this phenomenon neutral confinement. Analytical models of neutral confinement, made tractable by the assumption of perfect plastogenetic congruence, formally connect mutation rate, the topography of phenotype space, and evolvability. These models identify three mutational regimes: that corresponding to neutral confinement, an exploration threshold corresponding to a breakdown of neutral confinement with the simultaneous persistence of the dominant phenotype, and a classic error threshold corresponding to the loss of the dominant phenotype. In a final step, we analyze the structural properties of canalized phenotypes. The reduction of plasticity leads to extreme modularity, which we analyze from several perspectives: thermophysical (melting—the RNA version of a norm of reaction), kinetic (folding pathways—the RNA version of development), and genetic (transposability—the insensitivity to genetic context). The model thereby suggests a possible evolutionary origin of modularity as a side effect of environmental canalization.},

Models of the early stages of viral spread provide crude methods for estimating the basic reproductive rate of the virus, given a knowledge of the incubation period of the disease (AIDS) and the initial doubling time of the epidemic. More complex models are formulated to assess the influence of variation in the incubation period and heterogeneity in sexual activity. The latter factor is shown to have a major effect on the predicted pattern of the epidemic; high levels of heterogeneity decrease its magnitude. Areas of biological uncertainty, future research needs, and public health implications are discussed.},

The time to extinction of the disease starting in quasi-stationarity (conditional on non-extinction) is exponentially distributed. As the population size grows the epidemic process converges to a diffusion process. Properties of the limiting diffusion are used to obtain an approximate expression for tau, the mean-parameter in the exponential distribution of the time to extinction for the finite population The expression is used to study how tau depends on the community size but also on certain properties of the disease/community: the basic reproduction number and the means and Variances of the latency period, infectious period and life-length. Effects of introducing a vaccination program are also discussed as is the notion of the critical community size, defined as the size which distinguishes between the two qualitatively different behaviours.},

   Journal = {Journal of Hygiene},
   Volume = {94},
   Number = {3},
   Pages = {365-436},
   Abstract = {Mathematical models are developed to aid in the investigation of the implications of heterogeneity in contact with infection within a community, on the design of mass vaccination programmes for the control of childhood viral and bacterial infections in developed countries. Analyses are focused on age-dependency in the rate at which individuals acquire infection, the question of 'who acquires infection from whom', and the implications of genetic variability in susceptibility to infection. Throughout, theoretical predictions are based on parameter estimates obtained from epidemiological studies and are compared with observed temporal trends in disease incidence and age-stratified serological profiles. Analysis of case notification records and serological data suggest that the rate at which individuals acquire many common infections changes from medium to high and then to low levels in the infant, child and teenage plus adult age groups respectively. Such apparent age-dependency in attack rate acts to reduce slightly the predicted levels of herd immunity required for the eradication of infections such as measles, when compared with the predictions of models based on age-independent transmission. The action of maternally derived immunity in prohibiting vaccination in infants, and the broad span of age classes over which vaccination currently takes place in the U.K., however, argue that levels of herd immunity of between 90 and 94% would be required to eliminate measles. Problems surrounding the interpretation of apparent age-related trends in the acquisition of infection and their relevance to the design of vaccination programmes, are discussed in relation to the possible role of genetically based variation in susceptibility to infection and observations on epidemics in 'virgin' populations. Heterogeneous mixing models provide predictions of changes in serology and disease incidence under the impact of mass vaccination which well mirror observed trends in England and Wales.},

   Volume = {197},
   Pages = {270-278},
   Abstract = {The 1918 –1919 A/H1N1 inﬂuenza pandemic killed ~50 million people worldwide. Historical records suggest that an early pandemic wave struck Europe during the summer of 1918. We obtained surveillance data that were compiled weekly, during 1910 –1919, in Copenhagen, Denmark; the records included medically treated inﬂuenza-like illnesses (ILIs), hospitalizations, and deaths by age. We used a Serﬂing seasonal regression model to quantify excess morbidity and mortality, and we estimated the reproductive number (R) for the summer, fall, and winter pandemic waves. A large epidemic occurred in Copenhagen during the summer of 1918; the age distribution of deaths was characteristic of the 1918 –1919 A/H1N1 pandemic overall. That summer wave accounted for 29\%–34\% of all excess ILIs and hospitalizations during 1918, whereas the case-fatality rate (0.3\%) was many-fold lower than that of the fall wave (2.3\%). Similar patterns were observed in 3 other Scandinavian cities. R was substantially higher in summer (2.0 –5.4) than in fall (1.2–1.6) in all cities. The Copenhagen summer wave may have been caused by a precursor A/H1N1 pandemic virus that transmitted efﬁciently but lacked extreme virulence. The R measured in the summer wave is likely a better approximation of transmissibility in a fully susceptible population and is substantially higher than that found in previous US studies. The summer wave may have provided partial protection against the lethal fall wave. },

emergence for any novel pathogen. In general, diseases that initially have a large reproductive number

If disease transmission is independent of age, the system settles at epidemics of constant size in each season.

   Abstract = {It is unclear when, where and how novel pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV), monkeypox and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS) will cross the barriers that separate their natural reservoirs from human populations and ignite the epidemic spread of novel infectious diseases. New pathogens are believed to emerge from animal reservoirs when ecological changes increase the pathogen's opportunities to enter the human population(1) and to generate subsequent human- to-human transmission(2). Effective human- to- human transmission requires that the pathogen's basic reproductive number, R-0, should exceed one, where R-0 is the average number of secondary infections arising from one infected individual in a completely susceptible population(3). However, an increase in R-0, even when insufficient to generate an epidemic, nonetheless increases the number of subsequently infected individuals. Here we show that, as a consequence of this, the probability of pathogen evolution to R-0 > 1 and subsequent disease emergence can increase markedly.},

   Abstract = {We show that there is no two-stream instability in infinite homogenous self-gravitating stellar systems with Maxwellian velocity distributions, although it does occur for suitable non-Maxwellian streams.  In more realistic models, the effects of finite size and rotation must be taken into account.  We extend the stability analysis to finite, disk-like systems (counterstreaming Kalnajs disks).  By comparing the stability diagram of a counterstreaming disk with that of a reference single-stream disk, we can separate the two-stream instability from the Jeans instability inherent in any self-gravitating system.  We find that there is very little parameter space in which a counterstreaming Kalnajs disk can exhibit the two-stream instability for any mode except $(n,m)=(3,1)$.  Using a WKB dispersion relation, we examine the asymptotic behavior of high-order modes in the stability diagram and find that the results agree with those from numerical analysis of the exact dispersion relation.  Studying the modes for which the two-stream instability is possible, we find it is likely that the two-=stream instability sets in through a neutral mode: $\omega=0$.},

   Journal = {Bulletin of Mathematical Biology},
   Volume = {66},
   Number = {5},
   Pages = {1039-1091},
   Abstract = {A miscellany of new strategies, experimental techniques and theoretical approaches are emerging in the ongoing battle against cancer. Nevertheless, as new, ground-breaking discoveries relating to many and diverse areas of cancer research are made, scientists often have recourse to mathematical modelling in order to elucidate and interpret these experimental findings. Indeed, experimentalists and clinicians alike are becoming increasingly aware of the possibilities afforded by mathematical modelling, recognising that current medical techniques and experimental approaches are often unable to distinguish between various possible mechanisms underlying important aspects of tumour development. This short treatise presents a concise history of the study of solid tumour growth, illustrating the development of mathematical approaches from the early decades of the twentieth century to the present time. Most importantly these mathematical investigations are interwoven with the associated experimental work, showing the crucial relationship between experimental and theoretical approaches, which to-ether have moulded our understanding of tumour growth and contributed to current anti-cancer treatments. Thus, a selection of mathematical publications, including the influential theoretical studies by Burton, Greenspan, Liotta et al., McElwain and co-workers, Adam and Maggelakis, and Byrne and co-workers are juxtaposed with the seminal experimental findings of Gray et al. on oxygenation and radio-sensitivity, Folkman on angiogenesis, Dorie et al. on cell migration and a wide variety of other crucial discoveries. In this way the development of this field of research through the interactions of these different approaches is illuminated, demonstrating the origins of our current understanding of the disease.

   Journal = {Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems Series B},
   Volume = {4},
   Number = {1},
   Pages = {39-58},
   Abstract = {In this paper a mathematical model is presented that describes
growth, immune escape, and siRNA treatment of tumors. The model consists
of a system of nonlinear, ordinary differential equations describing tumor cells
and immune effectors, as well as the immuno-stimulatory and suppressive cytokines
IL-2 and TGF-β. TGF-β suppresses the immune system by inhibiting
the activation of effector cells and reducing tumor antigen expression. It also
stimulates tumor growth by promoting angiogenesis, explaining the inclusion
of an angiogenic switch mechanism for TGF-β activity. The model predicts
that increasing the rate of TGF-β production for reasonable values of tumor
antigenicity enhances tumor growth and its ability to escape host detection.
The model is then extended to include siRNA treatment which suppresses
TGF-β production by targeting the mRNA that codes for TGF-β, thereby reducing
the presence and effect of TGF-β in tumor cells. Comparison of tumor
response to multiple injections of siRNA with behavior of untreated tumors
demonstrates the effectiveness of this proposed treatment strategy. A second
administration method, continuous infusion, is included to contrast the ideal
outcome of siRNA treatment. The model’s results predict conditions under
which siRNA treatment can be successful in returning an aggressive, TGF-β
producing tumor to its passive, non-immune evading state.},

We suggest that simple models may be a better way to plan for a threatening pandemic with location and parameters as yet unknown, reserving more detailed network models for disease outbreaks already underway in localities where the social networks are well identified.
We formulate compartmental models to describe outbreaks of influenza and attempt to manage a disease outbreak by vaccination or antiviral treatment. The models give an important prediction that may not have been noticed in other models, namely that the number of doses of antiviral treatment required is extremely sensitive to the number of initial infectives. This suggests that the actual number of doses needed cannot be estimated with any degree of reliability. The model is applicable to pre-epidemic vaccination, such as annual vaccination programs in anticipation of an ‘ordinary’ influenza outbreak with limited drift, and as a combination of treatment both before and during an epidemic.},

   Volume = {281},

   Pages = {61-66},
   Abstract = {Context  Recent increases in infectious disease mortality and concern about emerging infections warrant an examination of longer-term trends.

Objective  To describe trends in infectious disease mortality in the United States during the 20th century.

Design and Setting  Descriptive study of infectious disease mortality in the United States. Deaths due to infectious diseases from 1900 to 1996 were tallied by using mortality tables. Trends in age-specific infectious disease mortality were examined by using age-specific death rates for 9 common infectious causes of death.

Subjects  Persons who died in the United States between 1900 and 1996.

Main Outcome Measures  Crude and age-adjusted mortality rates.

Results  Infectious disease mortality declined during the first 8 decades of the 20th century from 797 deaths per 100,000 in 1900 to 36 deaths per 100,000 in 1980. From 1981 to 1995, the mortality rate increased to a peak of 63 deaths per 100,000 in 1995 and declined to 59 deaths per 100,000 in 1996. The decline was interrupted by a sharp spike in mortality caused by the 1918 influenza epidemic. From 1938 to 1952, the decline was particularly rapid, with mortality decreasing 8.2% per year. Pneumonia and influenza were responsible for the largest number of infectious disease deaths throughout the century. Tuberculosis caused almost as many deaths as pneumonia and influenza early in the century, but tuberculosis mortality dropped off sharply after 1945. Infectious disease mortality increased in the 1980s and early 1990s in persons aged 25 years and older and was mainly due to the emergence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 25- to 64-year-olds and, to a lesser degree, to increases in pneumonia and influenza deaths among persons aged 65 years and older. There was considerable year-to-year variability in infectious disease mortality, especially for the youngest and oldest age groups.

Conclusions  Although most of the 20th century has been marked by declining infectious disease mortality, substantial year-to-year variation as well as recent increases emphasize the dynamic nature of infectious diseases and the need for preparedness to address them.},

the course of viral infections. IFN is not only a host

relatively few studies have attempted to correlate levels of
IFN in serum with clinical signs and symptoms [3-5].
Colorado tick fever (CTF) is a viral illness common in
Utah and characterized by fever and leukopenia[ 6]. CTF
virus is a potent inducer of IFN in mice [7], but to our
knowledge, the IFNr response in patients with CTF has not
been documented previously. The purpose of this study
was as follows:( 1)to determine whether antiviral activity
was present in the serum of patients proven to have CTF,
(2) to characterize the antiviral activity as IFN, (3) to determine whether the IFN was virus induced (a) or immune (y), and (4) to correlates serum levels of IFN with the degree
of fever and leukopenia in these patients.},

In this contribution we show that globally stable behavior of coupled map lattices is facilitated by causal coupling, thus indicating a surprising relationship between stability and causality. The influence of causal versus non-causal coupling for synchronous and asynchronous updating as a function of coupling strength and for different neighborhoods is analyzed in detail.

   Abstract = {The common occurrence of adoption among birds and mammals presents evolutionary biologists with an explanatory challenge. The benefits to adoptees are self-evident, but the benefits to the adopter(s), the origin of the set of behaviours that constitute 'adoptive' behaviour, and the conditions for its spread in populations are not always clear. Explanations in terms of direct and indirect benefits to adopters and adoptees, and in terms of conflict between them have been suggested to account for the current functions and the evolutionary origin of 'adoptive' behaviour. In this paper we emphasize one aspect of the parenting behaviour associated with adoption that has been neglected: eve suggest that adoption in birds and mammals is a route for the transfer of learnt information through social learning of patterns of behaviour, including styles of parenting. By using simple models we show that learning parenting from non-parents may provide additional opportunities for the spread of the 'adoptive' behaviour itself, even when it has no selective advantage. We also offer an additional explanation for the adaptive significance of adoption for both adopters and adoptees. Our 'match-making' hypothesis suggests that in some cases, by adopting foreign young, parents provide their genetic young with future ecologically compatible, but genetically unrelated, mates.

When febrile, seriously ill patients are externally cooled and are sedated or paralyzed with drugs that suppress shivering, they may have a more rapid reduction of fever and reduced energy expenditure than if treated with antipyretic drugs alone. A risk/benefit assessment of the consequences of such treatment is not yet possible.},

   Abstract = {Measles incidence in England and Wales has fallen to an all- time low. Attention is now focused on preventing local outbreaks, and, in the long run, on the elimination of indigenous measles. A realistic age-structured (RAS) mathematical model of measles transmission is used to reconstruct the impact of measles vaccination in England and Wales from 1968 to the present and to evaluate the merits of future policy options. In general, the predictions of the model show good agreement with long-term age stratified case reports and seroprevalence surveys. The model underestimates the proportion of cases that are notified in 0-2-gear-old children. However, recent work suggests a high degree of misdiagnosis in this age group. Projections on the basis of the existing vaccination strategy in the UK suggest that the present level of measles vaccine coverage will be insufficient to eliminate small seasonal outbreaks of measles, This result is, however, sensitive to the assumed level of vaccine efficacy. Explorations of a variety of changes to current vaccination strategy favour a 2-dose schedule with the second dose administered at age 4 years irrespective of vaccination history. A vaccination campaign in school-age children, to reduce deficits in herd immunity, would accelerate progress towards measles elimination.},

The first term is similar to the case of a constant vector population p but with p replaced by the average vector population p (0). The maximum correction due to the second term is (epsilon(2)/8)\% and always tends to decrease R (0). The basic reproduction number R (0) is defined through the spectral radius of a linear integral operator. Four numerical methods for the computation of R (0) are compared using as example a model for the 2005/2006 chikungunya epidemic in La Reunion. The approximate formula and the numerical methods can be used for many other epidemic models with seasonality.},

As in the study of structured epidemic models in a constant environment, there is a need to emphasize the biological meaning of this spectral radius. In this paper we show that R (0) for periodic models is still an asymptotic per generation growth rate. We also emphasize the difference between this theoretical R (0) for periodic models and the "reproduction number" obtained by fitting an exponential to the beginning of an epidemic curve. This difference has been overlooked in recent studies of the H1N1 influenza pandemic.},

   Abstract = {We ﬁrst study an SIR system of diﬀerential equations with periodic co-- 
eﬃcients describing an epidemic in a seasonal environment. Unlike in a 
constant environment, the ﬁnal epidemic size may not be an increasing 
function of the basic reproduction number R0 or of the initial fraction of 
infected people. Moreover, large epidemics can happen even if R0 < 1. 
But like in a constant environment, the ﬁnal epidemic size tends to 0 
when R0 < 1 and the initial fraction of infected people tends to 0. When 
R0 > 1, the ﬁnal epidemic size is bigger than the fraction 1 -- 1/R0 of 
the initially nonimmune population. In summary, the basic reproduction 
R0 keeps it classical threshold property but many other properties are no 
longer true in a seasonal environment. These theoretical results should 
be kept in mind when analyzing data for emerging vector-borne diseases 
(West-Nile, dengue, chikungunya) or air-borne diseases (SARS, pandemic

Design: Modelling of the dynamics of the hospital system, using a discrete-event stochastic simulation model, which reflects the relation between demand and available bed capacity. Setting: Hypothetical acute hospital in England. Subjects: Simulated emergency admissions of all types except mental disorder. Main outcome measures: The risk of having no bed available for any patient requiring immediate admission; the daily risk that there is no bed available for at least one patient requiring immediate admission; the mean bed occupancy rate. Results: Risks are discernible when average bed occupancy rates exceed about 85%, and an acute hospital can expect regular bed shortages and periodic bed crises if average bed occupancy rises to 90% or more. Conclusions: There are limits to the occupancy rates that can be achieved safely without considerable risk to patients and to the efficient delivery of emergency care. Spare bed capacity is therefore essential for the effective management of emergency admissions, and its cost should be borne by purchasers as an essential element of an acute hospital service.},

   Abstract = {The analysis of the household distribution of cases of measles by means of chain-binomial 
models has been comparatively successful (see Bailey (1955) for discussion and bibliography). 
At the same time considerable variation in the time interval between successive cases has 
usually been observed, and this sometimes leads to difficulties in identifying the links of the 
chain. An attempt was therefore made to produce a model which would take these variations 
into account. The simplest feasible arrangement is to assume that after the receipt of 
infection there follows a latent period which is approximately normally distributed. Then 
comes a period of infectiousness which is effectively terminated after a constant time by the 
appearance of symptoms and removal of the individual concerned from circulation. The 
latent and infectious periods taken together constitute what is usually called the incubation 
period. Arguments in favour of this model have been set out in detail elsewhere (see Bailey 
(1954, 1955), to which reference should be made for a fuller discussion). Simple estimates of 
the four parameters involved were given for families with two susceptibles only. However, 
at least two of the large sample variances were high, and there was considerable doubt as to 
the efficiency achieved. The purpose of the present paper is accordingly to develop a 
maximum-likelihood scoring procedure which will give efficient estimates and also make 
available a goodness-of-fit test. },

The present paper gives the extensions required for dealing with families having more than two susceptibles. The case of three susceptibles, which is quite common, is described in some detail as it presents a few new features. Larger families can be analysed in a similar way, but the procedure becomes rapidly more complicated, especially as a misclassification of links in the chain develops into an item of major importance. Since there is at present little data on such families we shall give an indication only of how to take acount of all the complications involved.
 An illustrative example is provided here for families with three susceptibles using some excellent material that has very kindly been made available to me by Dr. R. E. Hope Simpson. The data are based on families residing in the Cirencester area during 1946-52 with three susceptible children under 15 years of age including at least one case of measles.},

   Abstract = {The paper discusses the applicability of some empirical and functional mathematical models of tumor growth to multicell tumor spheroids which are a three-dimensional experimental paradigm of prevascular tumors. A new mathematical model based on receptor-mediated regulation of growth is developed and tested and two additional functional models (autostimulation, competing populations) are analyzed. It is demonstrated that these models, defined by two autonomous differential equations, can describe spontaneous tumor regression. The concept of tumor magnification factor, a quantifier of positive feedback mechanisms, is elaborated.},

   Abstract = {We study a model of the chemostat with two species competing for two perfectly substitutable resources in the case of linear functional response. Lyapunov methods are used to provide sufficient conditions for the global asymptotic stability of the coexistence equilibrium. Then, using compound matrix techniques, we provide a global analysis in a subset of parameter space. In particular, we show that each solution converges to an equilibrium, even in the case that the coexistence equilibrium is a saddle. Finally, we provide a bifurcation analysis based on the dilution rate. In this context, we are able to provide a geometric interpretation that gives insight into the role of the other parameters in the bifurcation sequence.},

   Journal = {Mathmatical Biosciences},
   Volume = {180},
   Pages = {73-102},
   Abstract = {This paper is concerned with a general stochastic model for susceptible→infective→removed epidemics, among a closed finite population, in which during its infectious period a typical infective makes both local and global contacts. Each local contact of a given infective is with an individual chosen independently according to a contact distribution ‘centred’ on that infective, and each global contact is with an individual chosen independently and uniformly from the whole population. The asymptotic situation in which the local contact distribution remains fixed as the population becomes large is considered. The concepts of local infectious clump and local susceptibility set are used to develop a unified approach to the threshold behaviour of this class of epidemic models. In particular, a threshold parameter R* governing whether or not global epidemics can occur, the probability that a global epidemic occurs and the mean proportion of initial susceptibles ultimately infected by a global epidemic are all determined. The theory is specialised to (i) the households model, in which the population is partitioned into households and local contacts are chosen uniformly within an infective’s household; (ii) the overlapping groups model, in which the population is partitioned in several ways, with local uniform mixing within the elements of the partitions; and (iii) the great circle model, in which individuals are equally spaced on a circle and local contacts are nearest-neighbour. },

   Journal = {Mathematical Biosciences},
   Volume = {212},
   Number = {1},
   Pages = {69-87},
   Abstract = {The study of epidemics on social networks has attracted considerable attention recently. In this paper, we consider a stochastic SIR (susceptible -> infective -> removed) model for the spread of an epidemic on a finite network, having an arbitrary but specified degree distribution, in which individuals also make casual contacts, i.e. with people chosen uniformly from the population. The behaviour of the model as the network size tends to infinity is investigated. In particular, the basic reproduction number R-0, that governs whether or not an epidemic with few initial infectives can become established is determined, as are the probability that an epidemic becomes established and the proportion of the population who are ultimately infected by such an epidemic. For the case when the infectious period is constant and all individuals in the network have the same degree, the asymptotic variance and a central limit theorem for the size of an epidemic that becomes established are obtained. Letting the rate at which individuals make casual contacts decrease to zero yields, heuristically, corresponding results for the model without casual contacts, i.e. for the standard SIR network epidemic model. A deterministic model that approximates the spread of an epidemic that becomes established in a large population is also derived. The theory is illustrated by numerical studies, which demonstrate that the asymptotic approximations work well, even for only moderately sized networks, and that the degree distribution and the inclusion of casual contacts can each have a major impact on the outcome of an epidemic. },

   Journal = {Journal Of Theoretical Biology},
   Volume = {180},
   Number = {2},
   Pages = {141-150},
   Abstract = {We develop a model of a continuous fertilization process in which eggs and sperm are shed simultaneously, and in which the eggs are fertilized at a rate proportional to sperm density surrounding the egg mass. The model derives the ESS size and number of sperm in an ejaculate of an externally-fertilizing animal such as a fish species, in which the probability or intensity of sperm competition varies. It also predicts the ESS level of infertility (eggs remaining unfertilized after all sperm have died). Sperm size is assumed to increase sperm competitive ability (e.g. by increasing speed) and is also assumed to affect sperm longevity (either positively or negatively). Ejaculate expenditure is traded off against expenditure on obtaining further spawnings, and size and number of sperm can vary independently. The model predicts that the ESS ejaculate expenditure (product of sperm size and number) should increase, and that the ESS infertility should decrease with sperm competition intensity measured across species. Other results depend on the way that sperm size affects longevity. The available biological evidence suggests that longevity decreases with sperm size, probably because the main increase is in tail length which increases sperm energy expenditure. In this case, sperm size should increase with sperm competition intensity from an optimum at zero competition which maximizes the total distance travelled by the entire ejaculate in its lifetime, to an optimum for maximum sperm competition which maximizes the product of speed and sperm number. However, if longevity increases with sperm size, then the non-competitive optimal sperm size is greater than that for maximum competition, so that sperm size decreases with sperm competition intensity. Sperm numbers typically increase with sperm competition intensity, and always so if sperm competition is high enough, though decreases are possible over a range of low sperm competition intensity if (i) sperm longevity decreases with sperm size, and (ii) infertility is high enough.

It killed more people in twenty-four weeks than AIDS has killed in twenty-four years, more in a year than the Black Death killed in a century. But this was not the Middle Ages, and 1918 marked the first collision of science and epidemic disease. Magisterial in its breadth of perspective and depth of research, John M. Barry's The Great Influenza weaves together multiple narratives, with characters ranging from William Welch (founder of Johns Hopkins Medical School) to John D. Rockefeller and Woodrow Wilson.

   Abstract = {The current worst-case scenario for pandemic inﬂuenza planning is based on the catastrophic 1918--1919 pandemic. In this article, we examine the strength of cross-protection between successive waves of the 1918--1919 pandemic, which has remained a long-standing issue of debate. We studied monthly hospitalization and mortality rates for respiratory illness in 37 army camps, as well as the rates of repeated episodes of inﬂuenza infection during January-December 1918 in 8 military and civilian settings in the United States and Britain. A ﬁrst wave of respiratory illness occurred in US Army camps during March-May 1918 and in Britain during May-June, followed by a lethal second wave in the fall. The ﬁrst wave was characterized by high morbidity but had a lower fatality rate than the second wave (1.1\% vs. 4.7\% among hospitalized soldiers; P < .001 ). Based on repeated illness data, the ﬁrst wave provided 35\%–94\% protection against clinical illness during the second wave and 56\%– 89\% protection against death (P < .001 ). Exposure to inﬂuenza in the spring and summer of 1918 provided mortality and morbidity protection during the fall pandemic wave. The intensity of the ﬁrst wave may have differed across US cities and countries and may partly explain geographical variation in pandemic mortality rates in the fall. Pandemic preparedness plans should consider that immune protection could be naturally acquired during a ﬁrst wave of mild inﬂuenza illnesses.},

The hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequences of the 1918 virus were previously determined, We here report the sequence of the A/Brevig Mission/1/18 (H1N1) virus nonstructural (NS) segment encoding two proteins, NS1 and nuclear export protein. Phylogenetically, these genes appear to be close to the common ancestor of subsequent human and classical swine strain NS genes. Recently, the influenza A virus NS1 protein was shown to be a type I IFN antagonist that plays an important role in viral pathogenesis. By using the recently developed technique of generating influenza A viruses entirely from cloned cDNAs, the hypothesis that the 1918 virus NS1 gene played a role in virulence was tested in a mouse model, In a BSL3+ laboratory, viruses were generated that possessed either the 1918 NS1 gene alone or the entire 1918 NS segment in a background of influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1), a mouse-adapted virus derived from a human influenza strain first isolated in 1933, These 1918 NS viruses replicated well in tissue culture but were attenuated in mice as compared with the isogenic control viruses. This attenuation in mice may be related to the human origin of the 1918 NS1 gene, These results suggest that interaction of the NS1 protein with host- cell factors plays a significant role in viral pathogenesis.},

number of secondary cases produced by a typical primary case). Results indicated that vaccinating children can 
substantially reduce population-level illness attack rates over a wide range of scenarios. The greatest absolute 
reduction in inﬂuenza illness cases per season occurred at R values ranging from 1.2 to 1.6 for a given vaccine

intensity was low to intermediate. The indirect effects declined rapidly as transmission intensity increased. In a mild 
inﬂuenza season (R ¼ 1.1), approximately 19 million inﬂuenza cases could be prevented by vaccinating 70% of 
children. At most, nearly 100 million cases of inﬂuenza illness could be prevented, depending on the proportion of 
children vaccinated and the transmission intensity. Given the current worldwide threat of novel inﬂuenza A (H1N1), 
with an estimated R of 1.4–1.6, health ofﬁcials should consider strategies for vaccinating children against novel

   Abstract = {We develop a moment closure approximation (MCA) to a network model of sexually transmitted disease (STD) spread through a steady/casual partnership network. MCA has been used previously to approximate static, regular lattices, whereas application to dynamic, irregular networks is a new endeavour, and application to sociologically-motivated network models has not been attempted. Our goals are 1) to investigate issues relating to the application of moment closure approximations to dynamic and irregular networks, and 2) to understand the impact of concurrent casual partnerships on STD transmission through a population of predominantly steady monogamous partnerships. We are able to derive a moment closure approximation for a dynamic irregular network representing sexual partnership dynamics, however, we are forced to use a triple approximation due to the large error of the standard pair approximation. This example underscores the importance of doing error analysis for moment closure approximations. We also find that a small number of casual partnerships drastically increases the prevalence and rate of spread of the epidemic. Finally, although the approximation is derived for a specific network model, we can recover approximations to a broad range of network models simply by varying model parameters which control the structure of the dynamic network. Thus our moment closure approximation is very flexible in the kinds of network models it can approximate.},

   Number = {1573},
   Pages = {1669-1675},
   Abstract = { There exists an interplay between vaccine coverage, disease prevalence and the vaccinating behaviour of individuals. Moreover, because of herd immunity, there is also a strategic interaction between individuals when they are deciding whether or not to vaccinate, because the probability that an individual becomes infected depends upon how many other individuals are vaccinated. To understand this potentially complex interplay, a game dynamic model is developed in which individuals adopt strategies according to an imitation dynamic (a learning process), and base vaccination decisions on disease prevalence and perceived risks of vaccines and disease. The model predicts that oscillations in vaccine uptake are more likely in populations where individuals imitate others more readily or where vaccinating behaviour is more sensitive to changes in disease prevalence. Oscillations are also more likely when the perceived risk of vaccines is high. The model reproduces salient features of the time evolution of vaccine uptake and disease prevalence during the whole-cell pertussis vaccine scare in England and Wales during the 1970s. This suggests that using game theoretical models to predict, and even manage, the population dynamics of vaccinating behaviour may be feasible.},

   Abstract = {Human papillomavirus vaccine prevents infection by two major oncogenic types of the virus. Continued screening is needed in vaccinated women to prevent cancers caused by high-risk types not included in the vaccine. An exaggerated sense of protection from the vaccine could lead to a decline in the rate of screening among vaccinated women, which in principle could lead to an increase in the incidence of cervical cancer. We present a simple mathematical model of vaccination, screening, and disease incidence, including an analysis of the effect of data uncertainties. For a population with opportunistic screening and 30\% vaccine coverage, screening rates in vaccinated women would have to decline by at least 80\% (median value of probabilistic uncertainty analysis) before the incidence of cervical cancer would increase in the era since the introduction of the vaccine. By comparison, the decline needed is at least 49\% in a population with organised screening and 70\% vaccine coverage. In populations that have highly effective cervical screening programmes, incidence of cervical cancer starts to increase after smaller, but still substantial, decreases in screening. Introduction of 
vaccine is unlikely to lead to an increased incidence of cervical cancer as a result of diminished screening.},

Scalloped hammerhead, white, and thresher sharks are each estimated to have declined by over 75% in the past 15 years.

Here we show that in a general limiting sense the stochastic path describes a circular motion modulated by a slowly varying Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Numerical examples are shown for the Volterra predator-prey model, Sel'kov's model for glycolysis, and a damped linear oscillator.},

   Abstract = {Idiotypic networks, after being a dominating paradigm for more than a decade, have fallen out of fashion in parallel with the rapid success of molecular immunobiology. Today signs of a possible renaissance in idiotypic network studies are visible. For system biologists and also for physicists, the network idea remains attractive. Herein, a short account of the historical development of the paradigm is given. The necessary technical and conceptual ingredients for a theoretical description of idiotypic networks are briefly reviewed, and previous approaches are discussed. We also describe a minimalistic model developed in our group that allows for understanding the random evolution toward a highly nontrivial complex architecture. In the network, a connected large cluster of idiotype clones and many disconnected ones coexist, thus resembling the notion of central and peripheral parts proposed in the 'second-generation' version of the paradigm. The connected cluster consists of groups of idiotypic clones with clearly distinct statistical properties. The simplicity of the model allows for calculating the size of the groups and the number of inter- and intragroup links, which define the architecture. Aspects of idiotypic interactions in experimental medicine are discussed, along with the challenges to theory and experimentation.},

   Volume = {359},
   Pages = {427--437},
   Abstract = {The Chandrasekhar formula for dynamical friction applies to an isolated body traveling uniformly through a homogeneous collisionless background, e.g., dark matter in the Galactic disk or dark halo.  In a binary system interaction between the components via the background's distortion may vitiate a naive estimate with that formula of the orbital evolution through dynamical friction.  We perform a full calculation of the energy loss rate using the linearized collisionless Bolzmann equation for the case that the orbital velocity is small compared with the background's velocity dispersion.  Intuitively, this constraint would suggest that the binary components do not cooperate in the orbital decay, this justifying an estimate of the friction via the Chandrasekhar formla applied separately to each component.  The full calculation supports this view only partially.  It is found that the energy loss rate consists of a Chandrasekhar-like contribution for each binary component separately, together with a term representing the cumulative effect of all completed orbits.  The latter contribution, at first negligible compared with the Chadrasekhar contribution, grows roughly logarithmically with the age of the binary until it saturates when the number of completed orbits is of the order of the square of the ratio of the background's velocity dispersion to the orbital speed.  For wide binaries with separation $\sim0.01$--$0.1\,$pc immersed in the Galactic disk's dark matter, the additional term eventually augments the friction by a factor of 2 over the naive prediction of Chandrasekhar's formula.},

Most genetic groups have worldwide distribution; however, at least two of the groups appear to have a more limited circulation. To monitor the transmission pathways of measles virus, we observed the geographic distribution of genetic groups, as well as changes in them in a particular region over time. We found evidence of interruption of indigenous transmission of measles in the United States after 1993 and identified the sources of imported virus associated with cases and outbreaks after 1993. The pattern of measles genetic groups provided a means to describe measles outbreaks and assess the extent of virus circulation in a given area. We expect that molecular epidemiologic studies will become a powerful tool for evaluating strategies to control, eliminate, and eventually eradicate measles.},

pathways and regulatory networks leading to the development of distinct Th subsets. Such knowledge may lead to better 
strategies for developing diagnostics and therapies for these diseases. The differentiation of Th1, Th2, and Th17 effector 
cells is driven by signals originating from T cell and costimulator y receptors as well as cytokines in the surroundings of 
activated naive T helper cells. There are several proteins involved in the regulation of this differentiation process. Most of

   Abstract = {Comparison between formulae for the counting functions of the heights tn of the Riemann 
zeros and of semiclassical quantum eigenvalues En suggests that the tn are eigenvalues of 
an (unknown) hermitean operator H, obtained by quantizing a classical dynamical system 
with hamiltonian Hcl . Many features of Hcl are provided by the analogy; for example, 
the “Riemann dynamics” should be chaotic and have periodic orbits whose periods are 
multiples of logarithms of prime numbers. Statistics of the tn have a similar structure to 
those of the semiclassical En ; in particular, they display random-matrix universality at 
short range, and nonuniversal behaviour over longer ranges. Very reﬁned features of the 
statistics of the tn can be computed accurately from formulae with quantum analogues. 
The Riemann-Siegel formula for the zeta function is described in detail. Its interpreta- 
tion as a relation between long and short periodic orbits gives further insights into the 
quantum spectral ﬂuctuations. We speculate that the Riemann dynamics is related to the 
trajectories generated by the classical hamiltonian Hcl = XP .},

   Title = {Plague immunodetection in remains of religious exhumed from burial sites in central France},
   Journal = {Journal of Archaeological Science},
   Volume = {36},
   Pages = {616-621},
   Abstract = {The skeletons of four Benedictine nuns and two priests were exhumed from two burial sites in central
France. The corpses were dated to the 16th– 18th centuries (archaeological dating).
Thick layers of lime were associated with their burials. During the Second Plague Pandemic, lime was
associated with plague burials. We hypothesize that Yersinia pestis infection might have been the cause
of death of these religious.
A rapid diagnostic test for plague (RDT), that detects Y. pestis F1 antigen, was applied to all six putative
plague victims. Y. pestis F1 antigen was detected in all six skeletons (100%). The F1 antigen concentrations
ranged from 2.5 to 0.625 ng/ml. The eight samples used as negative controls yielded negative results.
Soils samples taken from archaeological sites related to both positive and negative samples tested
negative for F1 antigen.
In earlier reports we provided suggestive evidence that the RDT for plague might be diagnostic for the
detection of Yersinia pestis in ancient human remains. This putative evidence was based on four French
and one German reputed plague sites in which RDT for plague and PCR sequenced-based analyses were
performed. Both tests gave results consistent with our interpretation that RDT is effective in identifying
plague in skeletal remains.
Several different European putative plague burial sites are currently under investigation. We hope to
obtain additional material to allow statistical validation of our results obtained thus far.
We now confirm that the detection threshold of the RDT for plague (0.5 ng/ml) is sufficient for a retrospective
diagnosis of plague in ancient skeletal remains. This method supplements the historical record
with independent biologic evidence. Thus, our hypothesis that the six religious were infected by Y. pestis
during the plague outbreaks which occurred in the two sites, Poitiers and La Chaize-le-Vicomte, between
1587 and 1632, has independent biologic support.

We characterized bacterial diversity within the human gastric mucosa by using a small subunit 16S rDNA clone library approach and analyzed 1,833 sequences generated by broad-range bacterial PCR from 23 gastric endoscopic biopsy samples. A diverse community of 128 phylotypes was identified, featuring diversity at this site greater than previously described. The majority of sequences were assigned to the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria phyla. Ten percent of the phylotypes were previously uncharacterized, including a Deinococcus-related organism, relatives of which have been found in extreme environments but not reported before in humans. The gastric clone libraries from 19 subjects contained H. pylori rDNA; however, only 12 of these subjects tested positive for H. pylori by conventional laboratory methods. Statistical analysis revealed a large degree of intersubject variability of the gastric ecosystem. The presence of H. pylori did not affect the composition of the gastric community. This gastric bacterial rDNA data set was significantly different from sequence collections of the human mouth and esophagus described in other studies, indicating that the human stomach may be home to a distinct microbial ecosystem. The gastric microbiota may play important, as-yet-undiscovered roles in human health and disease.},

   Abstract = {This paper investigates the complex dynamics induced by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in multiserotype disease models. ADE is the increase in viral growth rate in the presence of immunity due to a previous infection of a different serotype. The increased viral growth rate is thought to increase the infectivity of the secondary infectious class. In our models, ADE induces the onset of oscillations without external forcing. The oscillations in the infectious classes represent outbreaks of the disease. In this paper, we derive approximations of the ADE parameter needed to induce oscillations and analyze the associated bifurcations that separate the types of oscillations. We then investigate the stability of these dynamics by adding stochastic perturbations to the model. We also present a preliminary analysis of the effect of a single serotype vaccination in the model. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Abstract = {In this paper, we identify a mechanism for chaos in the presence of noise. In a study of the SEIR model, which predicts epidemic outbreaks in childhood diseases, we show how chaotic dynamics can be attained by adding stochastic perturbations at parameters where chaos does not exist apriori. Data recordings of epidemics in childhood diseases are still argued as deterministic chaos. There also exists noise due to uncertainties in the contact parameters between those who are susceptible and those who are infected, as well as random fluctuations in the population. Although chaos has been found in deterministic models, it only occurs in parameter regions that require a very large population base or other large seasonal forcing. Our work identifies the mechanism whereby chaos can be induced by noise for realistic parameter regions of the deterministic model where it does not naturally occur.},

We embed an age-structured model into a Bayesian synthesis of multiple evidence sources to reveal substantial changes in contact patterns and health-seeking behavior throughout the epidemic, uncovering two similar infection waves, despite large differences in the reported levels of disease. We show how this approach, which allows for real-time learning about model parameters as the epidemic progresses, is also able to provide a sequence of nested projections that are capable of accurately reflecting the epidemic evolution.},

   Journal = {Ecological Monographs},
   Volume = {72},
   Number = {2},
   Pages = {169-184},
   Abstract = {Before the development of mass-vaccination campaigns. measles exhibited persistent fluctuations (endemic dynamics) in large British cities, and recurrent outbreaks (episodic dynamics) in smaller communities. The critical community size separating the two regimes was similar to300 000-500 000. We develop a model, the TSIR (Time-series Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model, that can capture both endemic cycles and episodic outbreaks in measles. The model includes the stochasticity inherent in the disease transmission (giving rise to a negative binomial conditional distribution) and random immigration. It is thus a doubly stochastic model for disease dynamics. It further includes seasonality in the transmission rates. All parameters of the model are estimated on the basis of time series data on reported cases and reconstructed susceptible numbers from a set of cities in England and Wales in the prevaccination era (1944-1966). The 60 cities analyzed span a size range from London (3.3 X 10(6) inhabitants) to Teignmouth (10 500 inhabitants). The dynamics of all cities fit the model well. Transmission rates scale with community size, as expected from dynamics adhering closely to frequency dependent transmission ("true mass action"). These rates are further found to reveal strong seasonal variation, corresponding to high transmission during school terms and lower transmission during the school holidays. The basic reproductive ratio, R, is found to be invariant across the observed range of host community size, and the mean proportion of susceptible individuals also appears to be constant. Through the epidemic cycle, the susceptible population is kept within a 3% interval. The disease is, thus. efficient in "regulating" the susceptible population-even in small cities that undergo recurrent epidemics with frequent extinction of the disease agent. Recolonization is highly sensitive to the random immigration process. The initial phase of the epidemic is also stochastic (due to demographic stochasticity and random immigration). However, the epidemic is nearly "deterministic" through most of the growth and decline phase.},

   Abstract = {Background, The Oka strain of live attenuated varicella virus was licensed for use in healthy children in the United States in March, 1995, We report a postmarketing evaluation of the short term safety of this vaccine within Kaiser Permanente, Methods. after licensure varicella vaccination was introduced into the preventive care program of the Northern California Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program. Potential adverse events after vaccination with varicella vaccine were identified from automated clinical databases of hospitalizations, emergency room visits and clinic visits. Deaths were identified from automated clinical databases at Kaiser as well as from the State death records for California, To evaluate safety, rates of diagnosis-specific events in the risk periods were compared with the rates of such diagnosis-specific events in two self control and one historical control period. Results. During the study period of April I, 1995, to December 31, 1996, a total of 89 753 adults and children received varicella vaccine, A total of 3200 relative risks were calculated, and of these 5 hospital diagnostic categories, 9 emergency visit diagnostic categories and 30 outpatient diagnostic categories demonstrated at least 1 relative risk with a P value of <0.05 in 1 or more age groups and in comparisons with 1 control period or more. The p value for these tests was not adjusted for multiple comparisons, Of these categories 14 demonstrated an increased risk either in more than 1 age group or against more than 1 comparison group. These categories included elective procedures, febrile seizure, febrile illness, well child, acute gastroenteritis, varicella,: congenital anomaly, "rule out sepsis," trauma, viral syndrome, apnea, back pain, congenital valvular heart disease and vision evaluation for glasses, Of these the outcomes of elective procedure, congenital anomaly, congenital valvular heart disease, well child and vision evaluation,for:glasses were judged not to have a biologically plausible association with vaccination, a second diagnostic grouping included febrile illness, viral illness, febrile seizure and "rule out sepsis," In an analysis of these events which adjusted for the concomitant administration of M-M-RI, vaccine, none of the associations was statistically associated with receipt of varicella vaccine. The diagnostic category of "rule out sepsis" still had a relative risk. of 1.95 with P = 0.02. None of the children in the "rule out sepsis" category had positive bacteriologic cultures from any other normally sterile site. Because of the large number of gastroenteritis cases, we reviewed a random sample of 100 exposed and 100 unexposed cases, From this review no consistent time association or clustering of any of these events was seen in the exposed follow-up time interval. Only gastroenteritis and negative evaluations for sepsis were thought to be possibly associated with receipt of varicella vaccine. Although there was a statistically significant increased risk over the entire 30 day-period, there was no clustering of these events within the 30-day window, Conclusion. In this study population of 89 753 children and adults, the varicella vaccine (Oka strain, Merck) appeared to have a favorable safety profile. In addition rates of varicella-like rash and of breakthrough cases were both low and consistent with the rates observed in prelicensure studies.},

   Pages = {doi: 10.1098/rsif.2009.0514},
   Abstract = {Although many stochastic models can accurately capture the qualitative epidemic patterns of 
many childhood diseases, there is still considerable discussion concerning the basic mechanisms generating these patterns; much of this stems from the use of deterministic models to try to understand stochastic simulations. We argue that a systematic method of analysing models 
of the spread of childhood diseases is required in order to consistently separate out the effects 
of demographic stochasticity, external forcing and modelling choices. Such a technique is provided by formulating the models as master equations and using the van Kampen system-size expansion to provide analytical expressions for quantities of interest. We apply this method to the susceptible – exposed – infected – recovered (SEIR) model with distributed exposed and infectious periods and calculate the form that stochastic oscillations take on in terms of the model parameters. With the use of a suitable approximation, we apply the formalism to analyse a model of whooping cough which includes seasonal forcing. This allows us to more accurately interpret the results of simulations and to make a more quantitative assessment of the predictions of the model. We show that the observed dynamics are a result of a macroscopic limit cycle induced by the external forcing and resonant stochastic oscillations about this cycle.},

   Abstract = {Purpose. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the potential of a dynamic, multicompartmental in vitro system simulating the human stomach and small intestine (TIM-1) for studying the behavior of oral drug dosage forms under various physiological gastrointestinal conditions. Methods. Two model drug compounds were studied in TIM-1: a lyophilized Lactobacillus strain and paracetamol ( acetaminophen). The Lactobacillus survival rate was determined by bacterial counting in the gastric and ileal effluents while simulating the conditions of the gastrointestinal tract of infants or adults. The availability for absorption of paracetamol from two oral dosage forms was investigated by measuring the drug concentration in jejunal dialysis fluid. The effect of gastrointestinal passage time and food intake on paracetamol absorption was also studied. Results. The Lactobacillus survival rate in both gastric and ileal effluents was higher during simulation of the infant compared to adult conditions. We also showed that (i) paracetamol absorption was faster when it was administered as a free powder than in sustained-release tablet form, (ii) a slow passage time resulted in a delay in the absorption of paracetamol, and (iii) there was a lower rate of absorption when paracetamol was ingested with a standard breakfast as opposed to water. The in vitro results were consistent with in vivo data, showing the predictive value of TIM-1. Conclusions. TIM-1 is a powerful tool for supplying valuable information about the effects of various gastrointestinal conditions on biopharmaceutical behavior and efficacy of drug delivery systems in the development of oral formulations.},

   Volume = {28},

   Pages = {1-13},
   Abstract = {Fever, the body's most manifest sign of infectious illness, is only one of a concatenation of complex, nonspecific host defense responses to infectious pathogens termed the acute-phase response. It develops in most endotherms via the activation of a combination of various autonomic and behavioral mechanisms. It also occurs in many ectotherms, most usually as the result of behavioral processes alone. Although fever may shorten disease duration and improve survival, antipyretic medications are nonetheless routinely prescribed, with apparently negligible adverse effects on the course and outcome of the disease. The popularity of antipyretics is probably due mostly to their moderating effects of the discomfort level and consequent alleviation of the anxiety of afflicted patients and/or their caregivers. But is treatment of fever really indicated? Would letting fever run its natural course be better? Recent data suggest that, while heat/fever may kill some pathogenic microbes, this would not seem to be its principal role. Rather, heat/fever would appear to serve an important adjuvant function by enhancing the effectiveness of certain. selective, stimulus-activated adaptive immune responses and thereby helping to compartamentalize the acute-phase response to the infected site. But arguably even more important may be its temporal modulation of the stimulus-induced generation of TNFalpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 early during the inmate immune response, thereby obviating the risk of the potential harmful effects that could result from their dysregulated co-expression.},

   Abstract = {Fever is thought to be caused by endogenous pyrogenic cytokines, which are elaborated and released into the circulation by systemic mononuclear phagocytes that are activated by exogenous inflammatory agents and transported to the preoptic-anterior hypothalamic area (POA) of the brain, where they act. Prostaglandin (PG) E2 is thought to be an essential, proximal mediator in the POA, and induced by these cytokines. It seems unlikely, however, that these factors could directly account for early production of PGE2 following the intravenous administration of bacterial endotoxic lipopolysaccharides (LPS), because PGE2 is generated before the cytokines that induce it are detectable in the blood and the before cyclooxygenase-2, the synthase that they stimulate, is expressed. Hence other, more quickly evoked mediators are presumed to be involved in initiating the febrile response; moreover, their message may be conveyed to the brain by a neural rather than a humoral pathway. This article reviews current conceptions of pyrogen signalling from the periphery to the brain and presents new developing hypotheses about the mechanism by which LPS initiates fever.},

   Abstract = {BACKGROUND. The United States is considering enacting a national health plan and global health care budget similar to those in other countries. There are few data on the effects of such policies on physicians and patients. METHODS. We conducted a telephone survey of 602 physicians in the United States, 507 physicians in Canada, and 519 physicians in the former West Germany from February through May 1991; the response rates were 44 percent, 49 percent, and 41 percent, respectively. Among other topics, the questionnaire included measures of satisfaction with the health care system and with medical practice. RESULTS. In the United States, 23 percent of the physicians surveyed thought the health care system worked well, as compared with 33 percent in Canada and 48 percent in West Germany. Seventy-three percent of U.S. physicians reported that patients' inability to afford necessary treatment was a serious problem, as compared with 25 percent in Canada and 15 percent in West Germany. Seventy-seven percent of West Germany physicians, 56 percent of Canadian physicians, and 54 percent of U.S. physicians said the shortage of competent nurses was a serious problem. In Canada, 50 percent of the respondents cited the lack of well-equipped medical facilities as a problem, as compared with 14 percent in the United States and 20 percent in West Germany. CONCLUSIONS. Programs of universal coverage and cost containment necessitate important trade-offs. In Canada and West Germany, physicians do not report serious problems of access to care for the poor and uninsured. In the United States, doctors do not face the limited access to sophisticated forms of medical technology that was reported in Canada or the diminished quality of some services reported in West Germany.},

   Abstract = {Compartmental models for stochastic epidemics are typically intractable mathematically, and extremely demanding to intractable, when studied by traditional numerical methods. Researchers have consequently resorted to deterministic approximations or simulation to investigate them. This paper describes an alternative numerical method, called here the Probability Vector Method (PVM), for analyzing such models. It has the potential of estimating the first few moments of a compartmentalized epidemic model over a sequence of times. For compartmental models with a constant, homogeneous population, this method can be relatively efficient in computational resources compared to simulation, and the error bounds have greater analytic justification. The methods proposed here provide an effective alternative to simulation, and since they are so radically different, the PVM and simulation constitute checks on one another. Computational studies of a stochastic Susceptible/Infective model and a highly-compartmentalized HIV/AIDS model of Bailey illustrate the methodology. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   Abstract = {HIV transmission models have become very complex. The behavior of some of these models may only be explored by uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, because the structural complexity of the model are coupled with a high degree of uncertainty in estimating the values of the input parameters. Uncertainty analysis may be used to assess the variability (prediction imprecision) in the outcome variable that is due to the uncertainty in estimating the input values. A sensitivity analysis can extend an uncertainty analysis by identifying which parameters are important in contributing to the prediction imprecision (i.e., how do changes in the values of the input parameters alter the value of the outcome variable). In this paper an uncertainty and a sensitivity analysis are described and applied; both analyses are based upon the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) scheme, which is an extremely efficient sampling design proposed by McKay, Conover \& Beckman (1979). The methods described in this paper have not previously been applied to deterministic models of disease transmission, although these models have many characteristics in common with the risk assessment models that the strategies were designed to investigate. The utility of the LHS uncertainty and the LHS/PRC (Latin Hypercube Sampling/Partial Rank Correlation) sensitivity analysis techniques are illustrated by analyzing a complex deterministic model of HIV transmission.},

Recently it was recommended in a number of countries including the USA to vaccinate all healthy children between 6 and 59 months of age as well. However, vaccination of immunologically na ̈ıve subjects against seasonal influenza may prevent the induction of heterosubtypic immunity against potentially pandemic strains of an alternative subtype, otherwise induced by infection with the seasonal strains.
Here we show in a mouse model that the induction of protective heterosubtypic immunity by infection with a human A/ H3N2 influenza virus is prevented by effective vaccination against the A/H3N2 strain. Consequently, vaccinated mice were no longer protected against a lethal infection with an avian A/H5N1 influenza virus. As a result H3N2-vaccinated mice continued to loose body weight after A/H5N1 infection, had 100-fold higher lung virus titers on day 7 post infection and more severe histopathological changes than mice that were not protected by vaccination against A/H3N2 influenza.
The lack of protection correlated with reduced virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses after A/H5N1 virus challenge infection. These findings may have implications for the general recommendation to vaccinate all healthy children against seasonal influenza in the light of the current pandemic threat caused by highly pathogenic avian A/H5N1 influenza viruses.},

Genetic changes linked to avian-human transmission of avian influenza virus

Last Updated: 2002-01-04 12:57:38 EST (Reuters Health)

By Will Boggs, MD

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Shared gene constellations in avian influenza viruses H5N1 and H9N2 may confer the ability to
cause infection and disease in humans, according to a report in the January issue of Journal of Medical Virology.

Avian influenza virus H5N1, which is closely related to an H9N2 quail influenza virus, caused an outbreak of febrile respiratory illness
in Hong Kong in 1997, the authors explain, and initial efforts to explain the ability of the avian virus to infect humans were
unproductive.

"In the case of influenza viruses, it had been assumed that the major barrier preventing avian strains from infecting humans was the
different kind of sugar molecules on the cell surface that the virus uses to bind to the cell it is going to infect," lead author Dr. Michael
Shaw, from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, told Reuters Health.

"The 1997 and 2000 instances of avian influenza infecting humans was an apparent violation of this mechanism since the ability of
these strains to bind more efficiently to avian cells than mammalian cells still appeared to be the case," Dr. Shaw continued. "There
was clearly some other factor involved allowing them to productively infect humans."

Dr. Shaw and colleagues, therefore, sequenced the entire open reading frames of 9 of the human H5N1 and both human H9N2
isolates in an attempt to identify molecular changes associated with the avian-human transmission of the virus.

The gene sequences of all isolates showed greater than 90% nucleotide similarity with avian virus sequences available in gene
databases, the authors report. The viruses were most closely related to H5N1 and H9N2 viruses isolated in live poultry markets in
Hong Kong in 1997.

Moreover, the report indicates, all isolates belonged to the same phylogenetic clade (clade I) for the non-glycoprotein genes.

The amino acid sequences of these clade I viruses were avian-like at 23 sites, human-like at 5 sites, and mixtures of the two at 4 other
sites, the researchers note.

"What appears to have changed was the nature of the internal genes of the virus," Dr. Shaw said. "This new gene constellation
appears to enable the virus to infect human cells even though they still possess typical avian surface glycoproteins."

"Fortunately," Dr. Shaw added, "this new trait does not appear to enable the virus to spread from human to human which will most
likely require some mutation in the surface glycoproteins to enable them to bind to human cells more efficiently."

"The most immediate implication for vaccine development is that we must be prepared for the appearance of totally new surface
antigens in human strains," Dr. Shaw concluded. "The main message for clinicians is that an unusual strain could appear anytime,
anywhere. Fortunately, these new strains are still identifiable as influenza A using rapid diagnostic tests and remain treatable with
currently licensed antivirals."

   Abstract = {How should ecologists and evolutionary biologists analyze nonnormal data that involve random effects? Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

   Abstract = {A plant lineage can compete for resources in a spatially variable environment by colonizing new areas, exploiting resources in those areas quickly before other plants arrive to compete with it, or tolerating competition once other plants do arrive. These specializations are ubiquitous in plant communities, but all three have never been derived from a spatial model of community dynamics—instead, the possibility of rapid exploitation has been either overlooked or confounded with colonization. We use moment equations, equations for the mean densities and spatial covariance of
competing plant populations, to characterize these strategies in a fully spatial stochastic model. The moment equations predict endogenous spatial pattern formation and the efficacy of spatial strategies under different conditions. The model shows that specializations for colonization, exploitation, and tolerance are all possible, and these are the only possible spatial strategies; among them, they partition all of the endogenous spatial structure in the environment.
The model predicts two distinct short-dispersal specializations where parents disperse their offspring locally, either to exploit empty patches quickly or to fill patches to exclude competitors.},

There are, however, few empirical studies to support theoretical approaches, because data are scarce. Weekly reports obtained since 1984 from a network of general practitioners spanning the entire French territory allows the analysis of the spatio-temporal dynamics of influenza over a fine spatial scale. This analysis indicates that diffusion over long distances, possibly due to global transportation systems, is so quick that homogeneous global mixing occurs before the epidemic builds up within infected patches. A simple model in which the total number of cases is given by the empirical time-series and cases are randomly assigned to patches according to the population weight of the patches exhibits the same spatio-temporal properties as real epidemic cycles: homogeneous mixing models constitute appropriate descriptions, except in the vicinity of the epidemic's peak, where geographic heterogeneities play a role.},

   Abstract = {Although it has been the subject of verbal theory since Darwin, the evolution of morphological trait allometries remains poorly understood, especially in the context of sexual selection. Here we present an allocation trade-off model that predicts the optimal pattern of allometry under different selective regimes. We derive a general solution that has a simple and intuitive interpretation and use it to investigate several examples of fitness functions. Verbal arguments have suggested cost or benefit scenarios under which sexual selection on signal or weapon traits may favor larger individuals with disproportionately larger traits (i.e., positive allometry). However, our results suggest that this is necessarily true only under a precisely specified set of conditions: positive allometry will evolve when the marginal fitness gains from an increase in relative trait size are greater for large individuals than for small ones. Thus, the optimal allometric pattern depends on the !  precise nature of net selection, and simple examples readily yield isometry, positive or negative allometry, or polymorphisms corresponding to sigmoidal scaling. The variety of allometric patterns predicted by our model is consistent with the diversity of patterns observed in empirical studies on the allometries of sexually selected traits. More generally, our findings highlight the difficulty of inferring complex underlying processes from simple emergent patterns.},

We introduce host immunity and viral immune escape to construct a non-neutral model. Our population dynamics can then be framed naturally in the context of population genetics, and we show that departure from neutrality is governed by the covariance between a strain's fitness and its distance from the original epidemic strain. We quantify the amount of antigenic evolution that takes place in excess of what is expected under neutrality and find that this excess amount is largest under strong host immunity and long epidemics.},

   Abstract = {Context Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease that first manifested in humans in China in November 2002 and has subsequently spread worldwide. Objectives To describe the clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes of SARS in the first large group of patients in North America; to describe how these patients were treated and the variables associated with poor outcome. Design, Setting, and Patients Retrospective case series involving 144 adult patients admitted to 10 academic and community hospitals in the greater Toronto, Ontario, area between March 7 and April 10, 2003, with a diagnosis of suspected or probable SARS. Patients were included if they had fever, a known exposure to SARS, and respiratory symptoms or infiltrates observed on chest radiograph. Patients were excluded if an alternative diagnosis was determined. Main Outcome Measures Location of exposure to SARS; features of the history, physical examination, and laboratory tests at admission to the hospital; and 21-day outcomes such as death or intensive care unit (ICU) admission with or without mechanical ventilation. Results Of the 144 patients, 111 (77%) were exposed to SARS in the hospital setting. Features of the clinical examination most commonly found in these patients at admission were self-reported fever (99%), documented elevated temperature (85%), nonproductive cough (69%), myalgia (49%), and dyspnea (42%). Common laboratory features included elevated lactate dehydrogenase (87%), hypocalcemia (60%), and lymphopenia,(54%). Only 2% of patients had rhinorrhea. A total of 126 patients (88%) were treated with ribavirin, although its use was associated with significant toxicity, including hemolysis (in 76%) and decrease in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL (in 49%). Twenty-nine patients (20%) were admitted to the ICU with or without mechanical ventilation, and 8 patients died (21-day mortality, 6.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9%-11.8%). Multivariable analysis showed that the presence of diabetes (relative risk [RR], 3.1; 95% CI, 1.4-7.2; P=.01) or other comorbid conditions (RR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1-5.8; P=.03) were independently associated with poor outcome (death, ICU admission, or mechanical ventilation). Conclusions The majority of cases in the SARS outbreak in the greater Toronto area were related to hospital exposure. In the event that contact history becomes unreliable, several features of the clinical presentation will be useful in raising the suspicion of SARS. Although SARS is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially in patients with diabetes or other comorbid conditions, the vast majority (93.5%) of patients in our cohort survived.},

   Number = {18},
   Pages = {7588-7593},
   Abstract = {During the 1918 inﬂuenza pandemic, the U.S., unlike Europe, put 
considerable effort into public health interventions. There was also 
more geographic variation in the autumn wave of the pandemic in 
the U.S. compared with Europe, with some cities seeing only a 
single large peak in mortality and others seeing double-peaked 
epidemics. Here we examine whether differences in the public 
health measures adopted by different cities can explain the vari- 
ation in epidemic patterns and overall mortality observed. We 
show that city-speciﬁc per-capita excess mortality in 1918 was 
signiﬁcantly correlated with 1917 per-capita mortality, indicating 
some intrinsic variation in overall mortality, perhaps related to 
sociodemographic factors. In the subset of 23 cities for which we 
had partial data on the timing of interventions, an even stronger 
correlation was found between excess mortality and how early in 
the epidemic interventions were introduced. We then ﬁtted an 
epidemic model to weekly mortality in 16 cities with nearly 
complete intervention-timing data and estimated the impact of 
interventions. The model reproduced the observed epidemic pat- 
terns well. In line with theoretical arguments, we found the 
time-limited interventions used reduced total mortality only mod- 
erately (perhaps 10 –30%), and that the impact was often very 
limited because of interventions being introduced too late and 
lifted too early. San Francisco, St. Louis, Milwaukee, and Kansas 
City had the most effective interventions, reducing transmission 
rates by up to 30 –50%. Our analysis also suggests that individuals 
reactively reduced their contact rates in response to high levels of 
mortality during the pandemic.},

   Abstract = {Immunology has traditionally been a qualitative science describing the cellular and molecular components of the immune system and their functions. Only quite recently have new experimental techniques paved the way for a more quantitative approach of immunology. Lymphocyte telomere lengths have been measured to get insights into the proliferation rate of different lymphocyte subsets, T-cell receptor excision circles have been used to quantify the daily output of new T cells from the thymus, and bromodeoxyuridine and stable isotope labeling have been applied to measure proliferation and death rates of naive and memory lymphocytes. A common problem of the above techniques is the translation of the resulting data into relevant parameters, such as the typical division and death rate of the different lymphocyte populations. Theoretical immunology has contributed significantly to the interpretation of such quantitative experimental data, thereby resolving diverse controversies and, most importantly, has suggested novel experiments, allowing for more conclusive and quantitative interpretations.

   Pages = {S202-S210},
   Abstract = {Acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with potent antipyretic and analgesic actions but with very weak anti-inflammatory activity. When administered to humans, it reduces levels of prostaglandin metabolites in urine but does not reduce synthesis of prostaglandins by blood platelets or by the stomach mucosa. Because acetaminophen is a weak inhibitor in vitro of both cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2, the possibility exists that it inhibits a so far unidentified form of COX, perhaps COX-3, In animal studies, COX enzymes in homogenates of different tissues vary in sensitivity to the inhibitory action of acetaminophen. This may be evidence that there are >2 isoforms of the enzyme. Recently, a variant of COX-2 induced with high concentrations of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was shown to be highly sensitive to inhibition by acetaminophen. Therefore COX-3 may be a product of the same gene that encodes COX-2, but have different molecular characteristics.},

   Pages = {S157-S161},
   Abstract = {Lesion and thermal stimulation studies suggest that temperature regulation is controlled by a hierarchy of neural structures. Effector areas for specific thermoregulatory responses are located throughout the brain stem and spinal cord. The preop tic region, in and near the rostral hypothalamus, acts as a coordinating center and strongly influences each of the lower effector areas. The preoptic area contains neurons that are sensitive to subtle changes in hypothalamic or core temperature. Preoptic thermosensitive neurons also receive a wealth of somatosensory input from skin and spinal thermoreceptors. In this way, preoptic neurons compare and integrate central and peripheral thermal information. As a result of this sensory integration and its control over lower effector areas, the preoptic region elicits the thermoregulatory responses that are the most appropriate for both internal and environmental thermal conditions. Thermosensitive preoptic neurons are also affected by endogenous substances, such as pyrogens. By reducing the activity of warm-sensitive neurons and increasing the activity of cold-sensitive neurons, pyrogens cause fever, a state in which all thermoregulatory responses have elevated set-point temperatures.},

   Volume = {{}},
   Pages = {doi: 10.1098/rsbl.2010.0020},
   Abstract = {Host behaviour towards infectious conspeciﬁcs is a crucial yet overlooked component of pathogen dynamics. Selection is expected to favour individuals who can recognize and avoid infected conspeciﬁcs in order to reduce their own risk of infection. However, evidence is scarce and limited to species employing chemical cues. Here, we experimentally examine whether healthy captive house ﬁnches (Carpodacus mexicanus) preferentially forage near a same-sex, healthy conspeciﬁc versus one infected with the directly transmissible pathogen Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), which causes lethargy and visible conjunctivitis. Interestingly, male house ﬁnches strongly preferred feeding near diseased conspeciﬁcs, while females showed no preference. This sex difference appeared to be the result of lower aggression rates in diseased males, but not in females. The reduced aggression of diseased males may act as an ‘evolutionary trap’ by presenting a historically beneﬁcial behavioural cue in the context of a new environment, which now includes a recently emerged, potentially fatal pathogen. Since MG can be directly transmitted during feeding, healthy males may inadvertently increase their risk of contracting MG. This behaviour is likely to signiﬁcantly contribute to the continued persistence of MG epidemics in wild populations.},

An elementary landscape is a landscape whose age-structure is described by only one transition matrix, giving the probability for a site to be disturbed, or to follow the process of succession. We first provide an analytical study of the range of dispersal rates that allow metapopulation persistence in an elementary landscape. Second, conditions for metapopulation persistence in a heterogeneous landscape are derived from results obtained in each elementary landscape. Three cases are distinguished. If the two ranges of dispersal rates defined in each elementary landscape overlap, the metapopulation persists in any mixture of the elementary landscapes. If these two dispersal rates ranges are non-overlapping, either the metapopulation goes extinct for some values of the proportion of the elementary landscapes, or two discontinuous ranges of dispersal rates allow the metapopulation persistence. The consequences of these results are discussed in terms of landscape management. In particular, it is shown that under some conditions, a rapid change in environment (from one elementary landscape to another one) might less often lead to metapopulation extinction than a slower change.

   Title = {{4th Possible SARS Case Reported in Southeast China Province}},
   Journal = {New York Times},
   Volume = {January 12, 2004},
   Pages = {A2},
   Abstract = {ONG KONG, Jan. 11 — Health officials said today that they had been notified of a third suspected case of severe acute respiratory syndrome in China's adjacent Guangdong Province, and they expressed growing worry over the weekend about the possibility of another outbreak here.

The latest patient is a 35-year-old man with no recent history of travel to Hong Kong and no apparent contact with wild animals — the suspected source of some cases — said Dr. Thomas Tsang, a community medicine consultant for the Hong Kong Department of Health. Dr. Tsang said that while Guangdong officials had notified Hong Kong, as required under recent medical cooperation agreements, few details, like whether the man had traveled anywhere other than Hong Kong, had been provided.

Roy Wadia, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, said that China's Ministry of Health in Beijing believed that the tests on the 35-year-old man were not yet conclusive, but that the ministry and the W.H.O. were seeking more information from Guangdong Province.

Its officials have been closely coordinating their epidemiological and scientific work with Hong Kong officials, with the result that the Hong Kong government has repeatedly released information before it becomes public on the mainland.

Guangdong province has already confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome in one case, a 32-year-old freelance television producer who was released from the hospital last Thursday, and has identified another suspected case, a 20-year-old waitress at a restaurant that served wild animals. After doctors here and in Guangdong identified SARS-like corona viruses in most of the civet cats that they tested in the province's wild animal markets, provincial officials ordered a week ago the slaughter of thousands of civets, which are relatives of the mongoose.

Dr. Yeoh Eng-kiong, Hong Kong's secretary of health, welfare and food, said on Saturday that the next three weeks represented a "high-risk period" in which the extent of SARS in Guangdong Province would be unclear and in which it would be crucial but difficult to prevent the spread of the disease here. Hong Kong, an autonomous Chinese territory, abuts Guangdong Province and serves as the financial and commercial capital of the region.

"This is a very sensitive period for us in Hong Kong because this is a period where there may be some of these corona viruses that may possibly come to Hong Kong," Dr. Yeoh warned.

Close to 400,000 people a day cross Hong Kong's land borders with Guangdong, roughly half commuting daily to jobs on the opposite side, making it one of the world's busiest frontiers. At the same time, Hong Kong is Asia's busiest air travel hub in terms of the number of international passengers, with 70 airlines providing service to 130 countries.

A series of global disease outbreaks over the past century, including SARS last spring and the Hong Kong flu epidemic in the late 1960's, have started in the extremely crowded towns and cities of Guangdong Province, spread to Hong Kong and then gone quickly around the world.

This morning, W.H.O. investigators visited the apartment block where the 32-year-old television producer lived before his illness, and examined the staircases, the ventilation system and the sanitation system, taking some samples, Mr. Wadia said.

Dr. Guan Yi, a Hong Kong University microbiologist working with Chinese scientists on the latest SARS cases, said at a news conference here on Jan. 5 that the corona virus believed to cause SARS had evolved since last spring. The "sublineage" of the virus that has showed up in civet cats and in the first confirmed human case of SARS in southeastern China this winter has more genes commonly found in human viruses and fewer genes commonly found in animal viruses than the sublineage of the SARS virus that infected thousands last spring, he said.

Other viruses, including influenza viruses, sometimes become more infectious in people when they have more genes commonly associated with human diseases. But Dr. Guan cautioned that it was too soon to conclude whether the new sublineage here in southeastern China this winter is more or less infectious than the previous outbreak.},

   Abstract = {We describe a family of circular, and elliptical, finite disks with a disk potential that is a power of the radius.

First we discuss circular disks whose circular rotation speed v is proportional to r^alpha, with any alpha> -1/2. The surface-density of the disks is expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions of 1-(Ro/r)^2. 
We give closed expressions for the full 3-D potentials in terms of hypergeometric functions of two variables. We express the potential and acceleration in the plane at r>Ro, and along the rotation axis, in terms of simple hypergeometric functions. All the multipoles of the disk are given. We then generalize to non-axisymmetric disks. The potential in the midplane is given in terms of the hypergeometric function of two variables. For integer values of 2 alpha the above quantities are given in more elementary terms. All these results follow straightforwardly from formulae we derive for the general, cutoff, power-law, triaxial ellipsoid.},

   Abstract = {The striking increase in mortality rates in Russia in the early 1990s occurred simultaneously with the government's erratic attempts to introduce market reforms. Other transition economies, such as Poland and the Czech Republic, avoided increases in death rates while they implemented rapid and deep reforms. Is there a link between mortality and the speed or depths of reforms, as suggested by other researchers [e.g. Sachs (1996) American Economic Review 86(2), 128233]? This paper uses aggregate data on 22 transition economies for 19891994 to investigate this question. While the relationship between an index of reform progress and death rates is ambiguous, death rates in these countries are correlated with measures of reform success, such as GDP growth and the inflation rate. Higher crime rates and higher unemployment rates are also related to larger increases in death rates.},

We show that years of poor fish supply coincided with increased hunting in nature reserves and sharp declines in biomass of 41 wildlife species. Local market data provide evidence of a direct link between fish supply and subsequent bushmeat demand in villages and show bushmeat's role as a dietary staple in the region. Our results emphasize the urgent need to develop cheap protein alternatives to bushmeat and to improve fisheries management by foreign and domestic fleets to avert extinctions of tropical wildlife.},

   Pages = {195-205},
   Abstract = {We have carried out an extensive set of Fokker-Planck simulations of the evolution of globular clusters on very long timescales, up to 600 times the initial core collapse time tcc. We consider an idealized equal mass star cluster, with a wide range of values for the total number of stars, 7000 less than N less than 2 x 106. Our models include the heating effect of compact binaries formed in three-body encounters, which halts the initial core collapse and drives a core reexpansion. Postcollapse gravothermal oscillations of the cluster core are found to occur for all N approximately greater than or equal to 8000. For 8000 approximately less than or equal to N approximately less than or equal to 11,000, the oscillation has a simple, regular waveform with a single, well-defined period. For N approximately equals 12,000, the oscillations become nonlinear in a process resembling a period doubling. For N approximately greater than or equal to 14,000, the waveform of the oscillations becomes increasingly more irregular with increasing N, resembling chaotic behavior for N approximately greater than or equal to 15,000. During the oscillations, the core radius and core mass vary dramatically: by more than a factor of 10 for N greater than 15,000, by more than a factor of 100 for N greater than 5 x 104, and by more than a factor of 1000 for N greater than 5 x 105. However, even during the times of maximum expansion, the core contains only a small fraction of the cluster mass. For most N values, the maximum core mass at any time after core collapse is less than 1% of the cluster mass. The exceptions lie in the range 5 x 104 approximately less than or equal to N approximately equal to or less than 2 x 105, where the maximum post-collapse core mass reaches approximately 2% of the cluster mass. We discuss the observational implications of these predictions.},

procedures that operate on implicit models are said to have the
plug-and-play property. Our work builds on recently developed
plug-and-play inference methodology for partially observed Markov
models. We introduce a class of implicitly specified Markov chains with
stochastic transition rates, and we demonstrate its applicability to
open problems in statistical inference for biological systems. As one
example, these models are shown to give if fresh perspective on measles
transmission dynamics. As a second example, we present a mechanistic

   Abstract = {Population dynamic models, commonly used tools in the study of epidemics and other complex population processes, are implicit non-linear mathematical equations. Inference based on such models can be difficult due to the problems associated with high dimensional parameters that may be non-identified and complex likelihood functions that are difficult to maximize. To address a problem of non-identifiability due to collinearity of parameter estimates in a mathematical model of the 1993 Milwaukee Cryptosporidium parvum outbreak, we examined the utility of a constrained profile likelihood approach. This method was used to study two parameters of interest from the mathematical model: (i) the rate of secondary transmission; (ii) the proportional increase in primary transmission due to water treatment failure. The estimated values of these parameters were shown to depend strongly on poorly understood aspects of Cryptosporidium epidemiology such as asymptomatic proportion and the population immune status. Our analysis demonstrated that the combination of a disease transmission model and a constrained profile likelihood procedure provides an effective approach for inference and estimation of important parameters regulating infectious disease outbreaks.

   Abstract = {The existence of adaptive host manipulation by parasites has received increasing empirical support in recent years. Here I develop an optimality model of the extent of host manipulation, incorporating within-host group size, relatedness and a range of realistic cost-benefit functions. The model highlights the cooperative nature of host manipulation, and the potential for cheating this entails. When relatedness in parasite groups is minimal, manipulation is suppressed, but not eradicated, reflecting the importance of interhost selection. A distinctive threshold phenomenon is predicted for a wide range of parameter values. Below the group size threshold, manipulation is zero. Above the threshold, the predicted behaviour depends critically on the biological details of the individual-group interaction. The host-manipulation model is discussed in the light of two potential applications. If parasite group size is assumed to be a static characteristic of a parasite species or strain, the model generates a set of comparative predictions best suited to macroparasite systems. Additionally, the model can be used to predict density-dependent behavioural changes in expanding groups of parasites, as seen in quorum-sensing bacteria.},

   Abstract = {Sensory stimuli reach the brain via the thalamocortical projection, a group of axons thought to be among the most powerful in the neocortex. Surprisingly, these axons account for only 15\% of synapses onto cortical neurons. The thalamocortical pathway might thus achieve its effectiveness via high-efficacy thalamocortical synapses or via amplification within cortical layer 4. In rat somatosensory cortex, we measured in vivo the excitatory postsynaptic potential evoked by a single synaptic connection and found that thalamocortical synapses have low efficacy. Convergent inputs, however, are both numerous and synchronous, and intracortical amplification is not required. Our results suggest a mechanism of cortical activation by which thalamic input alone can drive cortex.},

   Abstract = {Deaths during the 1918–19 influenza pandemic have been attributed to a hypervirulent influenza strain. Hence, preparations for the next pandemic focus almost exclusively on vaccine prevention and antiviral treatment for infections with a novel influenza strain. However, we hypothesize that infections with the pandemic strain generally caused self-limited (rarely fatal) illnesses that enabled colonizing strains of bacteria to produce highly lethal pneumonias. This sequential- infection hypothesis is consistent with characteristics of the 1918–19 pandemic, contemporaneous expert opinion, and current knowledge regarding the pathophysiologic effects of influenza viruses and their interactions with respiratory bacteria. This hypothesis suggests opportunities for prevention and treatment during the next pandemic (e.g., with bacterial vaccines and antimicrobial drugs), particularly if a pandemic strain–specific vaccine is unavailable or inaccessible to isolated, crowded, or medically underserved populations.},

   Journal = {Astronomy and Astrophysics},
   Volume = {288},
   Pages = {349-364},
   Abstract = {We present results showing an improvement of the accuracy of perturbation theory as applied to cosmological structure formation for a useful range of quasilinear scales. The Lagrangian theory of gravitational instability of an Einstein-de Sitter dust cosmogony investigated and solved up to the third order in the series of papers by Buchert (1989, 1992, 1993), Buchert & Ehlers (1993), Buchert (1994), Ehlers & Buchert (1994), is compared with numerical simulations. In this paper we study the dynamics of pancake models as a first step. In previous work (Coles et al. 1993; Melott et al. 1994a; Melott 1993) the accuracy of several analytical approximations for the modeling of large-scale structure in the mildly non-linear regime was analyzed in the same way, allowing for direct comparison of the accuracy of various approximations. In particular, the "Zel'dovich approximation" (Zel'dovich 1970, 1973, hereafter ZA) as a subclass of the first-order Lagrangian perturbation solutions was found to provide an excellent approximation to the density field in the mildly non-linear regime (i.e. up to a linear rms density contrast of σ=~2). The performance of ZA in hierarchical clustering models can be greatly improved by truncating the initial power spectrum (smoothing the initial data). We here explore whether this approximation can be further improved with higher-order corrections in the displacement mapping from homogeneity. We study a single pancake model (truncated power-spectrum with power-index n=-1) using cross-correlation statistics employed in previous work. We found that for all statistical methods used the higher-order corrections improve the results obtained for the first-order solution up to the stage when σ(linear theory) =~1. While this improvement can be seen for all spatial scales, later stages retain this feature only above a certain scale which is increasing with time. However, third-order is not much improvement over second-order at any stage. The total breakdown of the perturbation approach is observed at the stage, where σ(linear theory)=~2, which corresponds to the onset of hierarchical clustering. This success is found at a considerably higher non-linearity than is usual for perturbation theory. Whether a truncation of the initial power-spectrum in hierarchical models retains this improvement will be analyzed in a forthcoming work.},

   Abstract = {We report on a series of tests of Newtonian Lagrangian perturbation schemes using N--body simulations for various power--spectra with scale--independent indices in the range $-3$ to $+1$. The models have been evolved deeply into the non--linear regime of structure formation in order to probe the dynamical and statistical performance of the Lagrangian perturbation schemes (whose first--order solution contains as a subset the celebrated ``Zel'dovich--approximation'' (hereafter ZA). These tests reveal properties of the approximations at stages beyond the obvious validity of perturbation theory. Recently, another series of tests of different analytical and semi--numerical approximations for large--scale structure was conducted with the result that ZA displays the best dynamical performance in comparison with the N--body simulations, if the initial data were smoothed before evolving the model, i.e., a truncated form of ZA (TZA). We show in this Letter that the excellent performance of TZA can be further improved by going to second order in the Lagrangian perturbation approach. The truncated second--order Lagrangian scheme provides a useful improvement over TZA especially for negative power indices, which suggests it will be very useful for modelling standard scenarios such as ``Cold--'', ``Hot--'' and ``Mixed--Dark--Matter''.},

   Journal = {Pharmacoeconomics},
   Volume = {16},
   Number = {5},
   Pages = {563-576},
   Abstract = {Objective: To develop and apply a model to assess the economic value of a workplace influenza programme from the perspective of the employer. Design: The model calculated the avoided costs of influenza, including treatment costs, lost productivity, lost worker added value and the cost of replacing workers. Subtracted from this benefit were the costs associated with a vaccination programme, including administrative costs, the time to give the vaccine, and lost productivity due to adverse reactions. The framework of the model can be applied to any company to estimate the cost-benefit of an influenza immunisation programme. Setting: The model developed was applied to 4030 workers in the core divisions of a Brazilian pharma-chemical company. Results: The model determined a net benefit of $US 121 441 [129 335 Brazilian reals ($Brz)], or $US35.45 ($Brz37.75) per vaccinated employee (1997 values). The cost-benefit ratio was 1 : 2.47. The calculations were subjected to a battery of 1-way and 2-way sensitivity analyses that determined that net benefit would be retained as long as the vaccine cost remained below $US45.40 ($Brz48.40) or the vaccine was at least 32.5% effective. Other alterations would retain a net benefit as well, including several combinations of incidence rate and vaccine effectiveness. Conclusions: The analysis suggests that providing an influenza vaccination programme can incur a substantial net benefit for atl employer, although the size of the benefit will depend upon who normally absorbs the costs of treating influenza and compensating workers for lost work time due to illness, as well as the type of company in which the immunisation programme is applied.},

   Abstract = {A stage model traces key behavioural tactics and life-history traits that are involved in the transition from promiscuity with no parental care, the mating system that typifies reptiles, to that typical of most birds, social monogamy with biparental care. In stage I, females assumed increasing parental investment in precocial young, female choice of mates increased, female-biased mating dispersal evolved and population sex ratios became male biased. In stage II, consortships between mating partners allowed males to attract rare social mates, provided a mechanism for paternity assessment and increased female ability to assess mate quality. In stage III, relative female scarcity enabled females to demand parental investment contributions from males having some paternity certainty. This innovation was facilitated by the nature of avian parental care; i.e. most care-giving activities can be adopted in small units. Moreover, the initial cost of care giving to males was small compared with its benefit to females. Males, however, tended to decline to assume non-partitionable, risky, or relatively costly parental activities. In stage IV, altriciality coevolved with increasing biparental care, resulting in social monogamy. Approaches for testing behavioural hypotheses are suggested.},

   Abstract = {The second edition of this book is unique in that it focuses on methods for making formal statistical inference from all the models in an a priori set (Multi-Model Inference). A philosophy is presented for model-based data analysis and a general strategy outlined for the analysis of empirical data. The book invites increased attention on a priori science hypotheses and modeling.Kullback-Leibler Information represents a fundamental quantity in science and is Hirotugu Akaike's basis for model selection. The maximized log-likelihood function can be bias-corrected as an estimator of expected, relative Kullback-Leibler information. This leads to Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and various extensions. These methods are relatively simple and easy to use in practice, but based on deep statistical theory. The information theoretic approaches provide a unified and rigorous theory, an extension of likelihood theory, an important application of information theory, and are objective and practical to employ across a very wide class of empirical problems.The book presents several new ways to incorporate model selection uncertainty into parameter estimates and estimates of precision. An array of challenging examples is given to illustrate various technical issues.This is an applied book written primarily for biologists and statisticians wanting to make inferences from multiple models and is suitable as a graduate text or as a reference for professional analysts.},

   Journal = {Immunological Reviews},
   Volume = {216},
   Pages = {69-80},
   Abstract = {Stochastic and spatial aspects are becoming increasingly recognized as an important factor in T-cell activation. Activation occurs in an intrinsically noisy environment, requiring only a handful of agonist peptide-major histocompatibility complex molecules, thus making consideration of signal to noise of prime importance in understanding sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, it is widely established that surface-bound ligands are more effective at activation than soluble forms, while surface patternation has highlighted the role of spatial relocation in activation. Here we consider the results of a number of models of T-cell activation, from a realistic model of kinetic segregation-induced T-cell receptor (TCR) triggering through to simple queuing theory models. These studies highlight the constraints on cell activation by a surface receptor that recruits kinases. Our analysis shows that TCR triggering based on trapping of bound TCRs in regions of close proximity that exclude large ectodomain-containing molecules, such as the phosphatases CD45 and CD148, can effectively reproduce known signaling characteristics and is a viable 'signal transduction' mechanism distinct from oligomerization and conformation-based mechanisms. A queuing theory analysis shows the interrelation between sensitivity and specificity, emphasizing that these are properties of individual cell functions and need not be, nor are likely to be, uniform across different functions. In fact, threshold-based mechanisms of detection are shown to be poor at ligand discrimination because, although they can be highly specific, that specificity is limited to a small range of peptide densities. Time integration mechanisms however are able to control noise effectively, while kinetic proofreading mechanisms endow them with good specificity properties. Thus, threshold mechanisms are likely to be important for rapidly detecting minimal signaling requirements, thus achieving efficient scanning of antigen-presenting cells. However, for good specificity, time integration on a scale of hours is required.},

   Volume = {954},

   Pages = {19-18},
   Abstract = {Demographers have for a long time adopted an empirical approach to the study of the levels and trends of mortality, fertility, and population size. They depend for their analyses on data, usually collected until recent times by government and often for other purposes. Modern demography had its origins in Britain in the second half of the seventeenth century. The major focus of demographers has usually been on mortality, although fertility studies predominated in the 1960s and 1970s. Mortality decline in the West only became certain in the late nineteenth century. Until the 1960s the fastest mortality declines were for the young, but an unheralded mortality decline among the old thereafter became important. The world, especially in economically advanced countries, is faced with an increasingly high proportion of old people, explained largely, not by mortality decline, but by fertility decline. Explanations for the mortality transition place different emphases on the role of modern medicine, better nutrition, and behavioral and social change, particularly rising levels of education. Even among the old, at least until 85 years of age, there are wide differentials in mortality by educational level. Analysts have divided the mortality transition into stages: (1) high, pretransitional mortality, (2) early transitional mortality with the decline explained by the conquest of infectious disease, and (3) late transitional mortality largely attributable to degenerative disease. Some have now added stage (4), the reduction or delay in death from degenerative causes. Attempts have been made to effect the convergence of demographic and epidemiological approaches to the analysis of mortality, and they have been more successful in the case of medical demographic than in social demographic approaches.},

   Journal = {Communicable Disease Report Review},
   Volume = {4},
   Number = {6},
   Pages = {R70-3},
   Abstract = {The reported incidence of measles in children of secondary school age rose in 1992, after a progressive decline between 1988 and 1991. This rise was maintained in 1993. Several school and community based outbreaks of measles have occurred in the United Kingdom. This paper reports the investigation of an outbreak of measles based in a secondary school, which took place in 1992. Thirty clinical cases were detected among the school's 840 pupils and 10 sporadic cases occurred outside the school. Twenty-one of the school cases provided samples of serum, in 19 of which measles IgM was detected. The overall attack rate was 3.6%, with no significant differences attributable to age and sex. Vaccine efficacy was about 90%. This outbreak is one of the first to be described in the United Kingdom, although other countries (notably the United States) have reported measles in teenagers. The small degree of spread in the community may reflect the current high uptake of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the catch up campaign that took place in 1988. The feasibility and cost effectiveness of various policy options to prevent future outbreaks in secondary schools are now being evaluated.},

It has been suggested that the importance of these effects has been underestimated and that the influence of indirect effects may actually be of relatively greater significance than direct effects. Additionally, it has also been suggested that all indirect effects, both good genes and sexy son, are qualitatively equivalent. Here a counterpoint to these suggestions is offered. We argue two main points: (1) it is unlikely that indirect effects will commonly outweigh direct effects, and (2) that there are important differences between good genes and sexy son indirect effects that must be recognized. We suggest that acknowledgement of these distinctions will lead to increased understanding of processes operating in both sexual conflict and sexual selection.},

   Abstract = {Spontaneous tumour regression has followed bacterial, fungal, viral, and protozoal infections. This phenomenon inspired the development of numerous rudimentary cancer immunotherapies, with a history spanning thousands of years. Coley took advantage of this natural phenomenon, developing a killed bacterial vaccine for cancer in the late 1800s. He observed that inducing a fever was crucial for tumour regression. Unfortunately, at the present time little credence is given to the febrile response in fighting infections-no less cancer.
Rapidly growing tumours contain large numbers of leucocytes. These cells play a part in both defence and repair; however, reparative functions can also support tumour growth. Intratumoural infections may reactivate defensive functions, causing tumour regression.
Can it be a coincidence that this method of immunotherapy has been "rediscovered'' repeatedly throughout the centuries? Clearly, Coley's approach to cancer treatment has a place in the past, present, and future. It offers a rare opportunity for the development of a broadly applicable, relatively inexpensive, yet effective treatment for cancer. Even in cases beyond the reach of conventional therapy, there is hope.},

   Title = {On the epidemiology of influenza},
   Journal = {Virology Journal},
   Volume = {5},
   Abstract = {The epidemiology of influenza swarms with incongruities, incongruities exhaustively detailed by the late British epidemiologist, Edgar Hope-Simpson. He was the first to propose a parsimonious theory explaining why influenza is, as Gregg said, ''seemingly unmindful of traditional infectious disease behavioral patterns.'' Recent discoveries indicate vitamin D upregulates the endogenous antibiotics of innate immunity and suggest that the incongruities explored by Hope-Simpson may be secondary to the epidemiology of vitamin D deficiency. We identify - and attempt to explain nine influenza conundrums: (1) Why is influenza both seasonal and ubiquitous and where is the virus between epidemics? (2) Why are the epidemics so explosive? (3) Why do they end so abruptly? (4) What explains the frequent coincidental timing of epidemics in countries of similar latitude? (5) Why is the serial interval obscure? (6) Why is the secondary attack rate so low? (7) Why did epidemics in previous ages spread so rapidly, despite the lack of modern transport? (8) Why does experimental inoculation of seronegative humans fail to cause illness in all the volunteers? (9) Why has influenza mortality of the aged not declined as their vaccination rates increased? We review recent discoveries about vitamin D's effects on innate immunity, human studies attempting sick-to-well transmission, naturalistic reports of human transmission, studies of serial interval, secondary attack rates, and relevant animal studies. We hypothesize that two factors explain the nine conundrums: vitamin D's seasonal and population effects on innate immunity, and the presence of a subpopulation of ''good infectors.'' If true, our revision of Edgar Hope-Simpson's theory has profound implications for the prevention of influenza.},

   Abstract = {The dynamical structure of a galactic disk is changed by fluctuations in its gravitational potential field.  The orbits of stars are deflected, changing the velocity dispersion and angular-momentum distribution.  We derive an expression for the induced changes in the phase-space distribution function, finding them to be second order in the perturbing potential, and of the form of a diffusion in phase space.  We evaluate our result for a model transient spiral.  The radial-velocity dispersion of the stars increases in response to a steady sequence of perturbations as $t^{1/2}$, for low velocity stars, declining towards $t^{1/5}$ as the radial excursions of the stars become large in comparison to the spatial wavelength of the spirals.  The waves also transport angular momentum, allowing the disk to become more centrally concentrated.  In equilibrium the wave amplitude is controlled by the rate of dynamical cooling in the disk, and inasmuch as the gas also gives rise to star formation, the heating time scale may be similar to the galactic star-formation time scale.  Spiral waves may then rearrange the structure of the disk, as stars form out of the gas.  Our predictions are in good agreement with the age/velocity-dispersion relation observed in our $N$-body experiments, and we conclude that recurrent transient spirals naturally account for that observed for the solar neighborhood stars.},

Despite their fundamental and potential clinical significance, regulatory T (T-R) cells have not yet been incorporated in a coherent theory of the immune system. This article reviews experimental evidence and theoretical arguments supporting a model of TR cell dynamics, uncovering some of its most relevant biological implications. According to this model, the persistence and expansion of TR cell populations depend strictly on specific interactions they make with antigen- presenting cells (APCs) and conventional effector T (T-E) cells. This three-partner crossregulation imposes that TR cells feed on the specific autoimmune activities they suppress, with implications ranging from their interactions with other cells to their repertoire selection in the periphery and in the thymus, and to the relationship between these cells and the innate immune system. These implications stem from the basic prediction that the peripheral dynamics sort the CD4(+) T-cell repertoire into two subsets: a less diverse set of small clones of autoreactive effector and regulatory cells that regulate each other's growth, and a more diverse set of barely autoreactive T-E cell clones, whose expansion is limited only by APC availability. It is argued that such partitioning of the repertoire sets the ground for self-non-self discrimination.},

In this review, we argue that many central issues in behavioural ecology will soon become prohibitively difficult to investigate and interpret, thus impeding the rapid progress that characterizes the field. To address these challenges, behavioural ecologists should design studies not only to answer basic scientific questions but also to provide ancillary information for protection and management of their study organisms and habitats, and then share their biological insights with the applied conservation community.},

   Abstract = {The dynamics of viral shedding and symptoms following inﬂuenza virus infection are key factors when considering epidemic control measures. The authors reviewed published studies describing the course of inﬂuenza virus infection in placebo-treated and untreated volunteers challenged with wild-type inﬂuenza virus. A total of 56 different studies with 1,280 healthy participants were considered. Viral shedding increased sharply between 0.5 and 1 day after challenge and consistently peaked on day 2. The duration of viral shedding averaged over 375 participants was 4.80 days (95% conﬁdence interval: 4.31, 5.29). The frequency of symptomatic infection was 66.9% (95% conﬁdence interval: 58.3, 74.5). Fever was observed in 37.0% of A/H1N1, 40.6% of A/H3N2 (p ¼ 0.86), and 7.5% of B infections (p ¼ 0.001). The total symptoms scores increased on day 1 and peaked on day 3. Systemic symptoms peaked on day 2. No such data exist for children or elderly subjects, but epidemiologic studies suggest that the natural history might differ. The present analysis conﬁrms prior expert opinion on the duration of viral shedding or the frequency of asymptomatic inﬂuenza infection, extends prior knowledge on the dynamics of viral shedding and symptoms, and provides original results on the frequency of respiratory symptoms or fever.},

   Abstract = {Two and a half millennia ago Pythagoras initiated the scientific study of the pitch of sounds; yet our understanding of the mechanisms of pitch perception remains incomplete. Physical models of pitch perception try to explain from elementary principles why certain physical characteristics of the stimulus lead to particular pitch sensations. There are two broad categories of pitch-perception models: place or spectral models consider that pitch is mainly related to the Fourier spectrum of the stimulus, whereas for periodicity or temporal models its characteristics in the time domain are more important. Current models from either class are usually computationally intensive, implementing a series of steps more or less supported by auditory physiology, However, the brain has to analyze and react in real time to an enormous amount of information from the ear and other senses. How is all this information efficiently represented and processed in the nervous system? A proposal of nonlinear and complex systems research is that dynamical attractors may form the basis of neural information processing. Because the auditory system is a complex and highly nonlinear dynamical system, it is natural to suppose that dynamical attractors may carry perceptual and functional meaning. Here we show that this idea, scarcely developed in current pitch models, can be successfully applied to pitch perception.},

As our sensory systems are highly nonlinear, it is natural to suppose that number theory also plays an important role in the description of perception, including aesthetics. Here we present a mathematical construction, based on number-theoretical properties of the golden mean, that generates meaningful musical scales of different numbers of notes. We demonstrate that these numbers coincide with the number of notes that an equal-tempered scale must have in order to optimize its approximation to the currently used harmonic musical intervals. Scales with particular harmonic properties and with more notes than the twelve-note scale now used in Western music can be generated. These scales offer interesting new possibilities for artists in the emerging musical world of microtonality and may be rooted in objective phenomena taking place in the nonlinearities of our perceptual and nervous systems.},

   Abstract = {We present a general host-parasite model that unifies previous theory by investigating the coevolution of virulence, resistance, and tolerance, with respect to multiple physiological, epidemiological, and environmental parameters. Four sets of new predictions emerge. First, compared to virulence coevolving with resistance or tolerance, three-trait coevolution promotes more virulence and less tolerance, and broadens conditions under which pure defenses evolve. Second, the cost and efficiency of virulence and the epidemiological rates are the key factors of virulence coevolving with resistance and tolerance. Maximum virulence evolves for intermediate infection rate, at which coevolved levels of resistance and tolerance are both high. The influence of host and parasite background mortalities is strong on the evolution of defenses and weak on the coevolution of virulence. Third, evolutionary correlations between defenses can switch sign along single-parameter gradients. The evolutionary trade--off between resistance and tolerance may coevolve with virulence that either increases or decreases monotonically, depending on the underlying parameter gradient. Fourth, despite global attractiveness and stability of coevolutionary equilibria, not-so-rare and not-so-small mutations can beget large variation in virulence and defenses around equilibrium, in the form of transient ''evolutionary spikes.'' Implications for evolutionary management of infections are discussed and directions for future research are outlined.},

   Abstract = {All galaxies for which extended rotation curves are available contain a significant amount of dark matter.  The luminous matter is probably self-gravitating in the inner parts of the galaxy, while dark matter dominates beyond the optical radius.  The mass-to-light ratio of the luminous material, corrected for variations in the present rate of star formation, is remarkably constant and in agreement with classical population synthesis models.  Rotation curves are not featureless; rather, their shape correlates with their luminosity and size, with a preference for rising rotation curves for dwarf galaxies, and declining curves for bright compact galaxies.  The latter contain less dark matter than the typical average galaxy, the former more.  The variations in dark-to-luminous mass ratio and their correlation with galaxy properties provide material for models of galaxy formation, and may indicate that at least part of the dark material is baryonic.},

   Abstract = {Objective: To test the hypothesis that many nursing home residents with an apparently blunted fever response (maximum temperature < 101-degrees-F) may actually have a significant change in temperature (DELTA-T greater-than-or-equal-to 2.4-degrees-F) which is not recognized because of a low baseline temperature. Design: Retrospective chart review for cases of infection that met specific criteria and for chart-recorded baseline and infection temperatures. Chart-recorded baseline temperatures were prospectively compared with re-measurement of morning temperatures. Setting: Nursing Home Care Unit of the VAMC West Los Angeles. Patients: Random review of 40 residents' charts resulted in the detection of 69 infections among 26 residents over a 20-month period. Fifty randomly selected residents prospectively underwent comparison of chart-determined and actual re-measurement of baseline temperatures. Results: In 50 randomly selected residents, the mean oral baseline temperature of 97.4 +/- 0.2 (degrees-F +/- SEM ) closely approximated the mean nurse-recorded measures in the charts (97.6 +/- 0.1). Chart review detected 69 infections among 26 residents, with 53 episodes having a temperature recorded during the infection. The mean maximum temperature (T(max)) during an infection was 101.3 +/- 0.3 (degrees-F +/- SEM) but 47\% (25/53) of the episodes had a ''blunted'' fever response (T(max) < 101-degrees-F). Of the 25 ''blunted'' fevers (T(max) < 101-degrees-F), about one-fourth demonstrated an adequate change in temperature from baseline (DELTA-T greater-than-or-equal-to 2.4-degrees-F) but failed to reach 101-degrees-F because of a low baseline. Most infections (89\%) had a T(max) > 99-degrees-F. Conclusion: Establishing a nursing home patient's basal temperature and monitoring for changes in temperature (DELTA-T > 2.4-degrees-F) and/or lowering the threshold for recognition of fevers (to 99-degrees or 100-degrees-F) in nursing home residents with a change in function should assist in early recognition of infections.},

   Journal = {Nature},
   Volume = {452},
   Pages = {750-755},
   Abstract = {The threat posed by the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus requires public health authorities to prepare for a human pandemic. Although pre-pandemic vaccines and antiviral drugs might significantly reduce illness rates 1, 2, their stockpiling is too expensive to be practical for many countries. Consequently, alternative control strategies, based on non-pharmaceutical interventions, 
are a potentially attractive policy option. School closure is the measure most often considered. The high social and economic costs of closing schools for months make it an expensive and therefore controversial policy, and the current absence of quantitative data on the role of schools during influenza epidemics means there is little consensus on the probable effectiveness of 
school closure in reducing the impact of a pandemic. Here, from the joint analysis of surveillance data and holiday timing in France, we quantify the role of schools in influenza epidemics and predict the effect of school closure during a pandemic. We show that holidays lead to a 20–29% reduction in the rate at which influenza is transmitted to children, but that they have no detectable effect on the contact patterns of adults. Holidays prevent 16–18% of seasonal influenza cases (18–21% in children). By extrapolation, we find that prolonged school closure during a pandemic might reduce the cumulative number of cases by 13–17% (18–23% in children) and peak attack rates by up to 39–45% (47–52% in children). The impact of school closure would be reduced if it proved difficult to maintain low contact rates among children for a prolonged period. },

   Abstract = {As of June 11, 2009, a total of 17,855 probable or confirmed cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) had been reported in the United States. Risk factors for transmission remain largely uncharacterized. We characterize the risk factors and describe the transmission of the virus within households. Probable and confirmed cases of infection with the 2009 H1N1 virus in the United States were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with the use of a standardized case form. We investigated transmission of infection in 216 households — including 216 index patients and their 600 household contacts — in which the index patient was the first case patient and complete information on symptoms and age was available for all household members. An acute respiratory illness developed in 78 of 600 household contacts (13%). In 156 households (72% of the 216 households), an acute respiratory illness developed in none of the household contacts; in 46 households (21%), illness developed in one contact; and in 14 households (6%), illness developed in more than one contact. The proportion of household contacts in whom acute respiratory illness developed decreased with the size of the household, from 28% in two-member households to 9% in six-member households. Household contacts 18 years of age or younger were twice as susceptible as those 19 to 50 years of age (relative susceptibility, 1.96; Bayesian 95% credible interval, 1.05 to 3.78; P = 0.005), and household contacts older than 50 years of age were less susceptible than those who were 19 to 50 years of age (relative susceptibility, 0.17; 95% credible interval, 0.02 to 0.92; P = 0.03). Infectivity did not vary with age. The mean time between the onset of symptoms in a case patient and the onset of symptoms in the household contacts infected by that patient was 2.6 days (95% credible interval, 2.2 to 3.5). The transmissibility of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus in households is lower than that seen in past pandemics. Most transmissions occur soon before or after the onset of symptoms in a case patient. },

   Abstract = {In response to WHO raising the inﬂ uenza pandemic alert level from phase ﬁve to phase six, health oﬃcials around 
the world are carefully reviewing pandemic mitigation protocols. School closure (also called class dismissal in North 
America) is a non-pharmaceutical intervention that is commonly suggested for mitigating inﬂuenza pandemics. 
Health oﬃcials taking the decision to close schools must weigh the potential health beneﬁts of reducing transmission 
and thus case numbers against high economic and social costs, diﬃcult ethical issues, and the possible disruption of 
key services such as health care. Also, if schools are expected to close as a deliberate policy option, or just because of 
high levels of staﬀ absenteeism, it is important to plan to mitigate the negative features of closure. In this context, 
there is still debate about if, when, and how school closure policy should be used. In this Review, we take a 
multidisciplinary and holistic perspective and review the multiple aspects of school closure as a public health policy. 
Implications for the mitigation of the swine-origin inﬂ uenza A H1N1 pandemic are also discussed. },

   Abstract = {The effects of migration in a network of patch populations, or metapopulation, are extremely important for predicting the possibility of extinctions both at a local and a global scale. Migration between patches, synchronizes local populations and bestows upon them identical dynamics (coherent or synchronous oscillations), a feature that is understood to enhance the risk of global extinctions. This is one of the central theoretical arguments in the literature associated with conservation ecology. Here, rather than restricting ourselves to the study of coherent oscillations, we examine other types of synchronization phenomena that we consider to be equally important. Intermittent and out-of-phase synchronization are but two examples that force us to reinterpret some classical results of the metapopulation theory. In addition, we discuss how asynchronous processes (for example, random timing of dispersal) can paradoxically generate metapopulation synchronization, another non-intuitive result that cannot easily be explained by the standard theory.},

   Abstract = {In the current context of global infectious disease risks, a better understanding of the dynamics of major epidemics is urgently needed. Time-series analysis has appeared as an interesting approach to explore the dynamics of numerous diseases. Classical time-series methods can only be used for stationary time-series (in which the statistical properties do not vary with time). However, epidemiological time-series are typically noisy, complex and strongly non-stationary. Given this specific nature, wavelet analysis appears particularly attractive because it is well suited to the analysis of non-stationary signals. Here, we review the basic properties of the wavelet approach as an appropriate and elegant method for time-series analysis in epidemiological studies. The wavelet decomposition offers several advantages that are discussed in this paper based on epidemiological examples. In particular, the wavelet approach permits analysis of transient relationships between two signals and is especially suitable for gradual change in force by exogenous variables.},

   Number = {6},
   Pages = {1350-1358},
   Abstract = {By experimenting with a cellular automaton model of the immune system, we have reproduced affinity maturation of the antibody response, a somatic adaptation to a changing environment. The simulation allowed the isolation of a number of variables, e.g. the fraction of repertoire available, the magnitude of the change in affinity with mutation, the mutation frequency and its focus on the complementarity-determining regions (CDR) of the antibody. Multiple series of immunizations were run in machina where the contribution of each variable was evaluated against the maturation observed. We found that hypermutation is not necessary for affinity maturation if the repertoire of B cell specificities is sufficiently complete, but is essential when the B cell diversity is limited (which happens to be the case in vivo), as it fills the holes in the repertoire and allows selection by antigen. Maturation also depends on the magnitude of the change in affinity with mutation, and we supply some necessary limits on this parameter. For mutations confined to the CDR, the most efficient maturation occurs at mutation rates of 0.2 per paratope and per cell division. When mutations also affect the framework regions, the peak of the most effective CDR mutation rate moves progressively to lower values. A most sensitive parameter is the speed of maturation, which reflects the rate of expansion of mutated clones. Comparing it with biological observations can help to discriminate between alternative hypotheses on the phenomena of hypermutation and affinity.},

   Abstract = {A switch in specificity of avian influenza A viruses' hemagglutinin (HA) from avian-like (alpha 2-3 sialylated glycans) to human- like (alpha 2-6 sialylated glycans) receptors is believed to be associated with their adaptation to infect humans(1-4). We show that a characteristic structural topology - and not the alpha 2-6 linkage itself - enables specific binding of HA to alpha 2-6 sialylated glycans and that recognition of this topology may be critical for adaptation of HA to bind glycans in the upper respiratory tract of humans. An integrated biochemical, analytical and data mining approach demonstrates that HAs from the human- adapted H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, but not H5N1 (bird flu) viruses, specifically bind to long alpha 2-6 sialylated glycans with this topology. This could explain why H5N1 viruses have not yet gained a foothold in the human population(5,6). Our findings will enable the development of additional strategies for effective surveillance and potential therapeutic interventions for H5N1 and possibly other influenza A viruses.},

Exposure of cells to a synthetic version of PB1-F2 induces apoptosis, and influenza viruses with targeted mutations that interfere with PB1-F2 expression Induce less extensive apoptosis in human monocytic cells than those with intact PB1-F2.

   Abstract = {The purpose of this review article is to demonstrate via a few simple models the mechanism for a very general, universal instability---the Arnold diffusion---which occurs in the oscillating systems having more than two degrees of freedom.  A peculiar feature of this instability results in an irregular, or stochastic, motion of the system as if the latter were influenced by a random perturbation even though, in fact, the motion is governed by purely dynamical equations.  The instability takes place generally for very special initial conditions (inside the so-called stochastic layers) which are, however, everywhere dense in the phase space of the system.
The basic and simplest one of the models considered is that of a pendulum under an external periodic perturbation.  This model represents the behavior of nonlinear oscillations near a resonance, including the phenomenon of the stochastic instability within the stochastic layer of resonance.  All models are treated both analytically and numerically.  Some general regulations concerning the stochastic instability are presented, including a general, semi-quantitative method---the overlap criterion---to estimate the conditions for this stochastic instability as well as its main characteristics.},

   Volume = {14},
   Pages = {289--304},
   Abstract = {Modulational diffusion, a weak instability that frequently occurs in many-dimensional, nonlinear Hamiltonian systems, is studied both analytically and numerically.  Modulational diffusion arises when an oscillation in one of the degrees of freedom is phase modulated at a slow driving frequency, producing a ``modulational layer'' of overlapping resonances in phase spaces.  Because the motion within this layer is chaotic, any coupling to the oscillation of another degree of freedom produces a long-time diffusion of its associated action along the layer.  The diffusion rate for this process is evaluated analytically, and is compared with numerical calculations for a model, two-degree-of-freedom, nonautonomous Hamiltonian.  The diffusion coefficient is found to vary in a series of descending steps as the frequncy difference between the two oscillators is increased.  Good agreement between analytical and numerical results has been obtained over many orders of magnitude in the diffusion coefficient.},

We proceed step by step in order to tease apart the dynamical consequences of (i) the intrinsic nonlinearity of the host-pathogen system, (ii) the seasonal variation in transmission and (iii) the additional forcing caused by vaccinating in pulses. We document that the resonance phenomenon associated with pulse vaccination can have quantitative epidemiological implications and produce perverse effects such as an unexpected increase in the number of infectives as the vaccination frequency increases. Our findings emphasize the importance of carefully taking into account the dynamical properties of the disease when designing a pulse vaccination strategy. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

   Abstract = {One of the most accepted views in the theoretical literature on virulence evolution is that a parasite's virulence will evolve to higher levels when its host's background mortality rate increases. Surprisingly, however, although many sources of background mortality involve predation, there has not yet been any theoretical research that explicitly considers how the dynamics of this important ecological interaction affects virulence evolution. Here, we consider how predation affects virulence evolution by explicitly introducing a predator into a classical susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemiological model. We find that, contrary to previous predictions, different sources of host mortality affect virulence evolution in different ways. Moreover, the way in which virulence evolution is affected depends on how tightly coupled the predator's dynamics are to the host population, and this can result in somewhat counterintuitive results. For example, indirect ecological effects!   can cause elevated host mortality to result in the evolution of lower parasite virulence, even if this elevated mortality arises from factors unrelated to predation.},

   Abstract = {Despite improved control measures, Ebola remains a serious public health risk in African regions where recurrent outbreaks have been observed since the initial epidemic in 1976. Using epidemic modeling and data from two well-documented Ebola outbreaks (Congo 1995 and Uganda 2000), we estimate the number of secondary cases generated by an index case in the absence of control interventions (R-0). Our estimate of R-0 is 1.83 (SD 0.06) for Congo (1995) and 1.34 (SD 0.03) for Uganda (2000). We model the course of the outbreaks via an SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) epidemic model that includes a smooth transition in the transmission rate after control interventions are put in place. We perform an uncertainty analysis of the basic reproductive number R-0 to quantify its sensitivity to other disease-related parameters. We also analyse the sensitivity of the final epidemic size to the time interventions begin and provide a distribution for the final epidemic size. The control measures implemented during these two outbreaks (including education and contact tracing followed by quarantine) reduce the final epidemic size by a factor of 2 relative the final size with a 2-week delay in their implementation.

   Volume = {4},
   Number = {12},
   Pages = {155-166},
   Abstract = {The reproduction number, R, defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a primary case, is a crucial quantity for identifying the intensity of interventions required to control an epidemic. Current estimates of the reproduction number for seasonal influenza show wide variation and, in particular, uncertainty bounds for R for the pandemic strain from 1918 to 1919 have been obtained only in a few recent studies and are yet to be fully clarified. Here, we estimate R using daily case notifications during the autumn wave of the influenza pandemic (Spanish flu) in the city of San Francisco, California, from 1918 to 1919. In order to elucidate the effects from adopting different estimation approaches, four different methods are used: estimation of R using the early exponential-growth rate (Method 1), a simple susceptible exposed - infectious - recovered (SEIR) model (Method 2), a more complex SEIR-type model that accounts for asymptomatic and hospitalized cases ( Method 3), and a stochastic susceptible - infectious - removed (SIR) with Bayesian estimation (Method 4) that determines the effective reproduction number R-t at a given time t. The first three methods. t the initial exponential-growth phase of the epidemic, which was explicitly determined by the goodness-of-fit test. Moreover, Method 3 was also fitted to the whole epidemic curve. Whereas the values of R obtained using the first three methods based on the initial growth phase were estimated to be 2.98 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.73, 3.25), 2.38 (2.16, 2.60) and 2.20 (1.55, 2.84), the third method with the entire epidemic curve yielded a value of 3.53 (3.45, 3.62). This larger value could be an overestimate since the goodness-of-fit to the initial exponential phase worsened when we fitted the model to the entire epidemic curve, and because the model is established as an autonomous system without time-varying assumptions. These estimates were shown to be robust to parameter uncertainties, but the theoretical exponential-growth approximation (Method 1) shows wide uncertainty. Method 4 provided a maximum-likelihood effective reproduction number 2.10 (1.21, 2.95) using the first 17 epidemic days, which is consistent with estimates obtained from the other methods and an estimate of 2.36 (2.07, 2.65) for the entire autumn wave. We conclude that the reproduction number for pandemic influenza (Spanish flu) at the city level can be robustly assessed to lie in the range of 2.0 3.0, in broad agreement with previous estimates using distinct data.},

We explored the association between influenza death rates, transmissibility and several geographical and demographic indicators for the autumn and winter waves of the 1918–1919 pandemic in cities, towns and rural areas of England and Wales. Average measures of transmissibility, estimated by the reproduction number, ranged between 1.3 and 1.9, depending on model assumptions and pandemic wave and showed little spatial variation. Death rates varied markedly with urbanization, with 30–40\% higher rates in cities and towns compared with rural areas. In addition, death rates varied with population size across rural settings, where low population areas fared worse. By contrast, we found no association between transmissibility, death rates and indicators of population density and residential crowding. Further studies of the geographical mortality patterns associated with the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic may be useful for pandemic planning.},

   Volume = {136},
   Pages = {852-864},
   Abstract = {Recurrent epidemics of influenza are observed seasonally around the world with considerable health and economic consequences. A key quantity for the control of infectious diseases is the reproduction number, which measures the transmissibility of a pathogen and determines the magnitude of public health interventions necessary to control epidemics. Here we applied a simple epidemic model to weekly indicators of influenza mortality to estimate the reproduction numbers of seasonal influenza epidemics spanning three decades in the United States, France, and Australia. We found similar distributions of reproduction number estimates in the three countries, with mean value 1.3 and important year-to-year variability (range 0.9–2.1). Estimates derived from two different mortality indicators (pneumonia and influenza excess deaths and influenza-specific deaths) were in close agreement for the United States (correlation=0.61, P<0.001) and France (correlation=0.79, P<0.001), but not Australia. Interestingly, high prevalence of A/H3N2 influenza viruses was associated with high transmission seasons (P=0.006), while B viruses were more prevalent in low transmission seasons (P=0.004). The current vaccination strategy targeted at people at highest risk of severe disease outcome is suboptimal because current vaccines are poorly immunogenic in these population groups. Our results suggest that interrupting transmission of seasonal influenza would require a relatively high vaccination coverage (>60\%) in healthy individuals who respond well to vaccine, in addition to periodic re-vaccination due to evolving viral antigens and waning population immunity.},

   Journal = {New England Journal of Medicine},
   Volume = {361},
   Number = {7},
   Pages = {674-679},
   Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the spring of 2009, an outbreak of severe pneumonia was reported in conjunction with the concurrent isolation of a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV), widely known as swine flu, in Mexico. Influenza A (H1N1) subtype viruses have rarely predominated since the 1957 pandemic. The analysis of epidemic pneumonia in the absence of routine diagnostic tests can provide information about risk factors for severe disease from this virus and prospects for its control. METHODS: From March 24 to April 29, 2009, a total of 2155 cases of severe pneumonia, involving 821 hospitalizations and 100 deaths, were reported to the Mexican Ministry of Health. During this period, of the 8817 nasopharyngeal specimens that were submitted to the National Epidemiological Reference Laboratory, 2582 were positive for S-OIV. We compared the age distribution of patients who were reported to have severe pneumonia with that during recent influenza epidemics to document an age shift in rates of death and illness. RESULTS: During the study period, 87% of deaths and 71% of cases of severe pneumonia involved patients between the ages of 5 and 59 years, as compared with average rates of 17% and 32%, respectively, in that age group during the referent periods. Features of this epidemic were similar to those of past influenza pandemics in that circulation of the new influenza virus was associated with an off-season wave of disease affecting a younger population. CONCLUSIONS: During the early phase of this influenza pandemic, there was a sudden increase in the rate of severe pneumonia and a shift in the age distribution of patients with such illness, which was reminiscent of past pandemics and suggested relative protection for persons who were exposed to H1N1 strains during childhood before the 1957 pandemic. If resources or vaccine supplies are limited, these findings suggest a rationale for focusing prevention efforts on younger populations.},

Here, we compiled extensive archival records to quantify the pandemic mortality patterns in 2 Mexican cities, Mexico City and Toluca. We applied seasonal excess mortality models to age-specific respiratory mortality rates for 1915–1920 and quantified the reproduction number from daily data. We identified 3 pandemic waves in Mexico City in spring 1918, autumn 1918, and winter 1920, which were characterized by unusual excess mortality among people 25–44 years old. Toluca experienced 2-fold higher excess mortality rates than Mexico City but did not experience a substantial third wave. All age groups, including that of people >65 years old, experienced excess mortality during 1918–1920. Reproduction number estimates were <2.5, assuming a 3-d generation interval. Mexico experienced a herald pandemic wave with elevated young adult mortality in spring 1918, similar to the United States and Europe. In contrast to the United States and Europe, there was no mortality sparing among Mexican seniors >65 years old, highlighting potential geographical differences in preexisting immunity to the 1918 virus.

Here we explore geo- graphical variations in the reproduction number of influenza across equatorial, tropical and subtropical areas of Brazil, based on the analysis of weekly pneumonia and influenza (P&I) mortality time series in 27 states.

Estimates of the reproduction number were slightly lower for Brazil than for the USA or France (difference in mean R1⁄40.08, p,0.01) and displayed less between-year variation (p , 0.001). Our findings suggest a weak gradient in the reproduction number with population size, where R increases from low population in the North to high population in the South of Brazil. Our low estimates of the reproduction number suggest that influenza population immunity could be high on average in Brazil, potentially resulting in increased viral genetic diversity and rate of emergence of new variants. Additional epidemiological and genetic studies are warranted to further characterize the dynamics of influenza in the tropics and refine our understanding of the global circulation of influenza viruses.},

   Journal = {New England Journal of Medicine},
   Volume = {357},
   Number = {4},
   Pages = {370-379},
   Abstract = {Background
The prevalence of obesity has increased substantially over the past 30 years. We performed a quantitative analysis of the nature and extent of the person-to-person spread of obesity as a possible factor contributing to the obesity epidemic.
Methods
We evaluated a densely interconnected social network of 12,067 people assessed repeatedly from 1971 to 2003 as part of the Framingham Heart Study. The body- mass index was available for all subjects. We used longitudinal statistical models to examine whether weight gain in one person was associated with weight gain in his or her friends, siblings, spouse, and neighbors.
Results
Discernible clusters of obese persons (body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], ≥30) were present in the network at all time points, and the clusters extended to three degrees of separation. These clusters did not appear to be solely attributable to the selective formation of social ties among obese persons. A person’s chances of becoming obese increased by 57% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6 to 123) if he or she had a friend who became obese in a given interval. Among pairs of adult siblings, if one sibling became obese, the chance that the other would become obese increased by 40% (95% CI, 21 to 60). If one spouse became obese, the likelihood that the other spouse would become obese increased by 37% (95% CI, 7 to 73). These effects were not seen among neigh- bors in the immediate geographic location. Persons of the same sex had relatively greater influence on each other than those of the opposite sex. The spread of smok- ing cessation did not account for the spread of obesity in the network.
Conclusions
Network phenomena appear to be relevant to the biologic and behavioral trait of obesity, and obesity appears to spread through social ties. These findings have implications for clinical and public health interventions.},

We show here that during the asymptomatic phase of infection there is an extremely low total body load of latently infected resting CD4+ T cells with replication-competent integrated pro virus (<107 cells). The most prevalent form of HIV-1 DNA in resting and activated CD4+ T cells is a full-length, linear, unintegrated form that is not replication competent. The infection progresses even though at any given time in the lymphoid tissues integrated HIV-1 DNA is present in only a minute fraction of the susceptible populations, including resting and activated CD4+ T cells and macrophages.},

   Abstract = {Many fisheries management systems, even when based on apparently sound science, have failed to prevent severe overfishing. And even when successful in this sense, such systems have frequently resulted in a large degree of excess fishing capacity. The reason for these failures can often be found in a lack of consideration of the economic incentives affecting fishermen. Specifically, when forced to compete for a fixed total annual catch quota (TAC), fishermen are motivated to fish at high intensity, and to expand the fishing power of their vessels. Individual fishing quotas (IFQs) are being increasingly used as a method of altering economic incentives in a desirable way. IFQ systems, however, can also suffer severe shortcomings, unless substantial fees are extracted for the exclusive right to exploit a publicly owned resource. When combined with appropriate fees, or royalties, IFQs can indeed result in sustainable, profitable fisheries. There still remains the fundamental question of risk management, but this is also now beginning to be addressed. Thus there is now a strong hope for the future success of marine fisheries, at least within 200-mile coastal zones.},

   Abstract = {The discovery of three individuals suspected to have contracted variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (vCJD) through blood transfusions has heightened concerns that a secondary epidemic via human-to-human transmission could occur in the UK. The Department of Health responded immediately to this threat by banning those who had received blood transfusions since 1980 from donating blood. In this paper, we conduct a sensitivity analysis to explore the potential size of a blood-borne vCJD epidemic and investigate the effectiveness of public health interventions. A mathematical model was developed together with an expression for the basic reproduction number (R-0). The sensitivity of model predictions to unknown parameters determining the transmission of vCJD via infected blood was assessed under pessimistic modelling assumptions. We found that the size of the epidemic (up until 2080) was bounded above by 900 cases, with self-sustaining epidemics (R-0 > 1) also possible; but the scenarios under which such epidemics could arise were found to be biologically implausible. Under optimistic assumptions, public health interventions reduced the upper bound to 250 and further still when only biologically plausible scenarios were considered. Our results support the belief that scenarios leading to large or self-sustaining epidemics are possible but unlikely, and that public health interventions were effective.},

We analyze how a given attentional capacity affects feeding requirements, the optimal attentional focus during predator scanning, and the probability of detecting predators. Our model indicates that because of the complex interplay between the costs and benefits associated with a given attentional capacity, limited attention can be an optimal strategy, which allows effective and economical search for cryptic objects.},

   Abstract = {A debate in the US may soon swing in favor of recommending universal influenza vaccination for all babies aged 6 months and upwards, and could coincide with the licensing of a live vaccine that avoids the use of needles.
US experts are keeping a close watch on Ontario which, in 2000, became the only region in the world to introduce such a program, according to David Fedson, of Aventis Pasteur in France, who presented the case for universal vaccination today.
For more than 20 years, epidemiologists have gathered a growing body of data showing that influenza vaccination is effective, said Fedson. It reduces hospitalisations of young children with flu-related illnesses including secondary middle-ear infections, and lowers death rates among people aged over 65, from conditions exacerbated by 'flu, including heart disease and diabetes.
A recent Japanese study, in particular, demonstrated that vaccinating school-aged children leads to a reduction in winter season mortality in the elderly, he noted. This is consistent with the view that children are the primary initiators of household outbreaks and in the community.
US health officials currently recommend that 'flu vaccines be given to the elderly and to at-risk groups, including children with chronic conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, chronic heart disease, renal diseases and malignancies.
A second debate, about the type of vaccine to use, is likely to follow, said Fedson. The choice is between the traditional inactivated, injectable form and a new, live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), which can be squirted up the nose.  Fedson predicts that one LAIV, still awaiting FDA approval, will be licensed for the first time within the next year.
"The LAIV, if it's not so horribly expensive, will be fabulous in terms of administration," said Fedson. "You can have paramedics squirt the stuff in children's noses in day-care centers and school classrooms," he noted.
"And of course in pandemic situations you can immunize populations very quickly with a non-injectable vaccine," Fedson said. This approach would also avoid the risks of transmission of blood-borne pathogens such as hepatitis B and C, he added.
But the introduction of LAIV will not be a smooth one, however, as opponents may well argue the lack of long-term safety information, Fedson noted.
"Because it's a live vaccine you're going to have the anti-vaccination community come out of the woodwork, and say 'here's another vaccine that's going to cause side-effects, and they want us to give this to our children every year, not just once or twice.'"
However, he insisted, the new vaccine's efficacy is "stunning."},

Increases in the daily weight gain of pups are associated with heavier weights at independence and at 1 year of age, as well as with improved foraging success as juveniles and higher survival rates through the first year of life. These results suggest that the effects of helpers on the fitness of pups extend beyond weaning and that helpers may gain direct as well as indirect benefits by feeding pups.},

   Journal = {BMC Medicine},
   Volume = {7},
   Number = {30},
   Abstract = {Here we present a review of the literature of influenza modeling studies, and discuss how these models can provide insights into the future of the currently circulating novel strain of influenza A (H1N1), formerly known as swine flu. We discuss how the feasibility of controlling an epidemic critically depends on the value of the Basic Reproduction Number (R0). The R0 for novel influenza A (H1N1) has recently been estimated to be between 1.4 and 1.6. This value is below values of R0 estimated for the 1918–1919 pandemic strain (mean R0~2: range 1.4 to 2.8) and is comparable to R0 values estimated for seasonal strains of influenza (mean R0 1.3: range 0.9 to 2.1). By reviewing results from previous modeling studies we conclude it is theoretically possible that a pandemic of H1N1 could be contained. However it may not be feasible, even in resource-rich countries, to achieve the necessary levels of vaccination and treatment for control. As a recent modeling study has shown, a global cooperative strategy will be essential in order to control a pandemic. This strategy will require resource-rich countries to share their vaccines and antivirals with resource-constrained and resource-poor countries. We conclude our review by discussing the necessity of developing new biologically complex models. We suggest that these models should simultaneously track the transmission dynamics of multiple strains of influenza in bird, pig and human populations. Such models could be critical for identifying effective new interventions, and informing pandemic preparedness planning. Finally, we show that by modeling cross-species transmission it may be possible to predict the emergence of pandemic strains of influenza.},

Unemployment was associated with increased susceptibility to infection in adult humans. Lower social status in male monkeys was also associated with increased susceptibility, as was lower perceived social status in humans. The association of social status and susceptibility was accounted for primarily by increased risk in the lowest social status groups.

   Abstract = {Objective. The economic impact of routine vaccination of preschool children with inactivated influenza vaccine was investigated.
Design. A decision analysis was performed using data from the literature. Direct and indirect costs of each vaccination strategy were calculated and compared with a strategy of not vaccinating.
Setting. Two settings were evaluated: a setting in which vaccination was available during flexible hours and a setting in which vaccination was available only during usual work hours (8:00 am-5:00 pm).
Results. Vaccination resulted in a net cost savings in both settings. The net savings per vaccine recipient were $21.28 in the flexible setting and $1.20 in the restricted setting. Although the analysis was performed for the inactivated vaccine, sensitivity analysis showed that the nasal vaccine could also result in a net cost savings depending on the price of the cold-adapted vaccine when it is licensed.
Conclusion. Vaccinating preschool children is economically advantageous. Serious consideration should be given to recommending vaccination in this age group.},

Our model incorporates the formation and merging of dark matter haloes, the shock heating and radiative cooling of baryonic gas gravitationally confined in these haloes, star formation regulated by the energy released by evolving stars and supernovae, the merging of galaxies within dark matter haloes, and the spectral evolution of the stellar populations that are formed. The procedure that we describe is very flexible and can be applied to any hierarchical clustering theory. Our prescriptions for regulated star formation and galaxy mergers are motivated and constrained by numerical simulations. We are able to predict galaxy numbers, luminosities, colours and circular velocities. This investigation is restricted to the standard cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology, and we explore the effects of varying other assumptions, including the stellar initial mass function, star formation rates and galaxy merging. We compare the results of these models with an extensive range of observational data, including the B and K galaxy luminosity functions, galaxy colours, the Tully-Fisher relation, faint galaxy number counts, and the redshift distribution at B~22. This combination of observed galaxy properties strongly constrains the models and enables the relative importance of each of the physical processes included to be assessed. We present a broadly successful model defined by a plausible choice of parameters. This fiducial model produces a much more acceptable luminosity function than have most previous studies. This is achieved through a modest rate of galaxy mergers and strong suppression of star formation in haloes of low circular velocity by energy injected by supernovae and evolving stars. The model also accounts for the observed faint galaxy counts in both the B and K bands, and their redshift distributions. It fails, however, to produce galaxies as red as are many observed ellipticals and, compared with the observed Tully- Fisher relation, the model galaxies have circular velocities which are too large for their luminosities.},

   Volume = {7},
   Pages = {623-640},
   Abstract = {Measles epidemics in human populations exhibit what is perhaps the best empirically characterized, and certainly the most studied, stochastic persistence threshold in population biology. A critical community size (CCS) of around 250 000 – 500 000 separates populations where measles is predominantly persistent from smaller communities where there are frequent extinctions of measles between major epidemics. The fundamental mechanisms contributing to this pattern of persistence, which are long-lasting immunity to re-infection, recruitment of susceptibles, seasonality in transmission, age dependence of transmission and the spatial coupling between communities, have all been quantiﬁed and, to a greater or lesser level of success, captured by theoretical models. Despite these successes there has not been a consensus over whether simple models can successfully predict the value of the CCS, or indeed which mechanisms determine the persistence of measles over a broader range of population sizes. Speciﬁcally, the level of the CCS has been thought to be particularly sensitive to the detailed stochastic dynamics generated by the waiting time distribution (WTD) in the infectious and latent periods. We show that the relative patterns of persistence between models with different WTDs are highly sensitive to the criterion of comparison—in particular, the statistical measure of persistence that is employed. To this end, we introduce two new statistical measures of persitence—fade-outs post epidemic and fade-outs post invasion. Contrary to previous reports, we demonstrate that, no matter the choice of persistence measure, appropriately parametrized 
models of measles demonstrate similar predictions for the level of the CCS.},

Using simple models, we explore a relatively neglected relationship of how the CCS scales with birth rate. A predominantly positive relationship of persistence with birth rate is complicated by the accompanying dynamical transitions of the underlying deterministic process. We show that these transitions imply a lower CCS for high birth rate less developed countries and contrary to the experience in lower birth rate, industrial countries, the CCS may increase after vaccination. We also consider the evolutionary implications of the CCS for the origin of measles; this analysis explores how the deterministic and stochastic thresholds for invasion and persistence set limits on the mechanism by which this highly infectious pathogen could have successfully colonized its human host.},

   Abstract = {Individual animals routinely face decisions that are crucial to their fitness. In social species, however, many of these decisions need to be made jointly with other group members because the group will split apart unless a consensus is reached. Here, we review empirical and theoretical studies of consensus decision making, and place them in a coherent framework. In particular, we classify consensus decisions according to the degree to which they involve conflict of interest between group members, and whether they involve either local or global communication; we ask, for different categories of consensus decision, who makes the decision, what are the underlying mechanisms, and what are the functional consequences. We conclude that consensus decision making is common in non-human animals, and that cooperation between group members in the decision-making process is likely to be the norm, even when the decision involves significant conflict of interest.},

Those models are successful in explaining interval perception and the interval structure of common scales, but do not account for even the basics of triadic harmony. By introducing a 3-tone "tension" factor, I show how the sonority of the triads of diatonic music can be explained. Moreover, the relative size of the intervals among the partials in triads determines the major/minor modality of chords: major chords have a predominance of larger lower intervals, while minor chords have a predominance of smaller lower intervals. Finally, by invoking the ''frequency code'' known from linguistics and ethology, the positive/negative valence of the major/minor chords is shown to have an acoustical basis. I conclude that the perception of harmony can be explained by the acoustical structure of triads, without invoking cultural factors.},

   Abstract = {Background. A 15-year postmarketing evaluation of the impact of varicella vaccine on the age distribution of varicella disease is being conducted at Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, Northern California (KPMCP), We report on a baseline assessment of the age-specific incidence and hospitalization rates of varicella and herpes tester that was conducted before vaccine introduction. Methods. To assess the annual incidence of varicella, a telephone survey was conducted in a random sample of similar to 8000 youths 5 to 19 years of age, The annual incidence of hospitalizations for varicella and herpes tester in 1994 was assessed with the use of the computerized database at KPMCP. Results. Varicella annual incidence was 10.3% in 5- to 9-year-olds, 1.9% in 10- to 14-year-olds and 1.2% in the 15- to 19-year age groups, respectively, Hospitalization rates among the entire KPMCP membership were 2.6 and 2.1 per 100 000 person years for varicella and tester, respectively. Varicella incidence in the 15- to Is-year age group was higher among African-Americans than among Caucasians. Conclusions. Varicella rates were similar in the 5- to 9- and 10- to 14-year age groups to rates from other published studies conducted in 1972 to 1978, 1980 to 1988 and 1990 to 1992; however, the rate in 15- to 19-year-olds was 2 to 4 times higher than published rates in the same age category.},

   Abstract = {The accumulation of evidence that ecologically important traits often evolve at the same time and rate as ecological dynamics (e.g., changes in species’ abundances or spatial distributions) has outpaced theory describing the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes with comparable timescales. The disparity between experiment and theory is partially due to the high dimensionality of models that include both evolutionary and ecological dynamics. Here we show how the theory of fast-slow dynamical systems can be used to reduce model dimension, and we use that body of theory to study a general predator-prey system exhibiting fast evolution in either the predator or the prey. Our approach yields graphical methods with predictive power about when new and unique dynamics (e.g., completely out-of-phase oscillations and cryptic dynamics) can arise in ecological systems exhibiting fast evolution. In addition, we derive analytical expressions for determining when such behavior arises and how evolution affects qualitative properties of the ecological dynamics. Finally, while the theory requires a separation of timescales between the ecological and evolutionary processes, our approach yields insight into systems where the rates of those processes are comparable and thus is a step toward creating a general ecoevolutionary theory.},

   Abstract = {Small mammal populations exhibit cyclic fluctuations in their population densities. Several hypotheses regarding the mechanisms underlying these population cycles have been advanced, but none has yet gained general approval. We propose here an endogenous mechanism based on the masculinization of female offspring in response to increased population levels. High population levels trigger the non-specific stress response resulting in high levels of circulating androgens in individuals of the population, including pregnant females. These androgens masculinize female offspringin utero, thereby reducing the reproductive capacity of the next generation and subsequently the population size. We have developed and analysed a mathematical model to investigate the possible role of prenatal androgen exposure in the generation of limit cycles. We find the locus of Hopf bifurcations for this model and show that limit cycles depend on three parameters: (1) the delay between birth and sexual maturation; (2) the slope of the function that relates average prenatal androgen exposure to total population density; and (3) the difference between the maximum birth rates of the low- and high-androgen exposed females. We derive the analytical form relating these parameters at the Hopf-bifurcation locus and discuss its biological ramifications. In brief, in each of these three parameters is sufficiently large, population cycles will results from the endogenous mechanism proposed. },

   Abstract = {The propensity of influenza viruses to undergo rapid and unpredictable antigenic change has given influenza a prominent place among emerging and reemerging diseases.(29, 50, 81) Historical accounts suggest that influenza
viruses, which cause a highly contagious, febrile, acute respiratory illness in humans, have been around for centuries.(48) Epidemics of various severity have occurred almost annually. Pandemics of influenza, which generally
have had a more widespread and dramatic impact than annual epidemics, have occurred unpredictably at irregular intervals.

The three most dramatic events caused by influenza viruses during this century were the pandemics of "Spanish" influenza beginning in 1918, the 1957 "Asian" influenza, and most recently, the 1968 "Hong Kong" influenza.
In each pandemic, novel influenza viruses swept rapidly and pervasively around the globe and caused disease in all age groups.(78) Each pandemic was associated with high rates of morbidity, considerable social disruption,
and substantial economic losses. In addition, the Spanish influenza pandemic was associated with a relatively high case-fatality rate in young and previously healthy adults. This unique pattern of mortality had profound medical,
social, and political consequences.(13) Although not considered a true pandemic by many,(38) the reemergence in 1977 of influenza A (H1N1) viruses ("Russian" influenza) is also notable because these viruses swept rapidly
around the globe and caused considerable morbidity among individuals under 20 years of age.(78)

Two features of influenza virus replication and evolution account for the epidemiologic success of these viruses. First, there is relatively rapid and unpredictable antigenic change (antigenic drift) in the surface proteins,
hemagglutinin (HA), and neuraminidase (NA). Antigenic drift occurs as part of the continuing evolution of influenza viruses after they emerge in pandemic form and become established in humans. As antibody levels to the
pandemic strain rise within the human population, the circulating influenza viruses must change antigenically to survive. Antigenic drift renders an individual susceptible to new strains because the antigenically drifted influenza
viruses are able to escape neutralization by antibody to previously circulating strains. Annual epidemics occur during the interpandemic period because sufficient numbers of individuals in the population become susceptible to the
antigenically variant strain.

Second, there is the emergence of novel influenza A viruses in humans (antigenic shift). Antigenic shift occurs when certain animal influenza viruses, which normally infect only avian or swine reservoirs and are unrelated to the
influenza viruses currently circulating in humans, are transmitted to humans. Evidence suggests that emergence of novel pandemic strains may occur either after genetic reassortment between human and animal influenza viruses
or, alternatively, via direct transmission of an animal strain to humans.(80, 81) Thus, antigenic shift is defined as the appearance in the human population of a new influenza virus containing a novel HA or novel HA and NA that
are immunologically distinct from those of the influenza viruses that have been circulating in man in recent decades. A pandemic takes place when human-to-human transmission of these novel viruses occurs and leads to disease
in a large and immunologically susceptible human population.},

The emphasis is on the simplest generic bifurcations in one-parameter systems. Two applications are developed in detail: a Hopf bifurcation occurring in a model of three-wave mode coupling and steady-state bifurcations occurring in the real Landau-Ginzburg equation. The former provides an example of the importance of degenerate bifurcations in problems with more than one parameter and the latter illustrates new effects introduced into a bifurcation problem by a continuous symmetry.},

   Abstract = {Early theoretical work on disease invasion typically assumed large and well-mixed host populations. Many human and wildlife systems, however, have small groups with limited movement among groups. In these situations, the basic reproductive number, R-0, is likely to be a poor predictor of a disease pandemic because it typically does not account for group structure and movement of individuals among groups. We extend recent work by combining the movement of hosts, transmission within groups, recovery from infection and the recruitment of new susceptibles into a stochastic model of disease in a host metapopulation. We focus on how recruitment of susceptibles affects disease invasion and how population structure can affect the frequency of superspreading events (SSEs). We show that the frequency of SSEs may decrease with the reduced movement and the group sizes due to the limited number of susceptible individuals available. Classification tree analysis of the model results illustrates the hierarchical nature of disease invasion in host metapopulations. First, the pathogen must effectively transmit within a group (R-0 > 1), and then the pathogen must persist within a group long enough to allow for movement among the groups. Therefore, the factors affecting disease persistence-such as infectious period, group size and recruitment of new susceptibles-are as important as the local transmission rates in predicting the spread of pathogens across a metapopulation.},

   Abstract = {The hawk-dove game has proved to be an important tool for understanding the role of aggression in social interactions. Here, the game is presented in a more general form (GHD) to facilitate analyses of interactions between individuals that may differ in "size", where size is interpreted as a surrogate for resource holding power. Three different situations are considered, based on the availability and use of information that interacting individuals have about their sizes: the classical symmetric case, in which no information about sizes is used, the asymmetric case, in which the individuals know their relative sizes and thus their chances of prevailing in combat, and a mixed-symmetry case, in which each individual only knows its own size (or only knows its opponent's size). I describe and use some recently developed methods for multitype games-evolutionary games involving two or more categories of players. With these methods and others, the evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs) that emerge for the three different cases are identified and compared. A proof of the form and uniqueness of the-ESS for the mixed-symmetry case is presented. In this situation, one size category at most can play a mixed strategy; larger individuals are aggressive and smaller individuals are not. As the number of size categories approaches infinity and the size distribution becomes continuous, there is a threshold size, above which all individuals are aggressive, and below which they are not.

   Pages = {15259-15264},
   Abstract = {Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a phenomenon in which 
viral replication is increased rather than decreased by immune sera, 
has been observed in vitro for a large number of viruses of public 
health importance, including ﬂaviviruses, coronaviruses, and ret- 
roviruses. The most striking in vivo example of ADE in humans is 
dengue hemorrhagic fever, a disease in which ADE is thought to 
increase the severity of clinical manifestations of dengue virus 
infection by increasing virus replication. We examine the epide- 
miological impact of ADE on the prevalence and persistence of viral 
serotypes. Using a dynamical system model of n cocirculating 
dengue serotypes, we ﬁnd that ADE may provide a competitive 
advantage to those serotypes that undergo enhancement com- 
pared with those that do not, and that this advantage increases 
with increasing numbers of cocirculating serotypes. Paradoxically, 
there are limits to the selective advantage provided by increasing 
levels of ADE, because greater levels of enhancement induce large 
amplitude oscillations in incidence of all dengue virus infections, 
threatening the persistence of both the enhanced and nonen- 
hanced serotypes. Although the models presented here are spe- 
ciﬁcally designed for dengue, our results are applicable to any 
epidemiological system in which partial immunity increases patho- 
gen replication rates. Our results suggest that enhancement is 
most advantageous in settings where multiple serotypes circulate 
and where a large host population is available to support pathogen 
persistence during the deep troughs of ADE-induced large ampli- 
tude oscillations of virus replication. },

Public Lecture I: "The Science of Stem Cells"
In 1999, Science Magazine highlighted Stem Cells as the "Breakthrough of
the Year", based on the isolation of human embryonic stem cells, startling
revelations about stem cell plasticity, and the conviction that patients
of the 21st century stand to benefit from harnessing the potential of Stem
Cells for cellular and genetic therapies. Tissue replacement is the
optimal treatment for a wide array of degenerative disorders, especially
since organ transplantation cannot meet all the needs of an aging
population. The realization that Stem Cells from embryonic and somatic
tissues can differentiate into a diversity of tissues and provide a
renewable resource for regenerative therapies has stimulated enormous
interest in these versatile cells and their applications in human disease.
Dr. Daley will provide a layman's overview of the exciting science behind
the revolution in stem cell biology and the brazen new technologies for
therapeutic and reproductive cloning, while providing a realistic
projection about the immediate and future prospects for medical
breakthroughs.

Public Lecture II: "The Stem Cell Debate: Science Confronts Politics"
The isolation of human embryonic stem cells entails the destruction of
human embryos, and this has stimulated a debate about the morality of this
research. One perspective holds that human life begins with conception and
that a human life should not be sacrificed even for medical therapies to
help scores of others. On the contrary are those who believe that
embryonic stem cells represent the best hope for cures for countless human
diseases, and that the needs of patients justifies the sacrifice of early
embryos. Alongside this debate is the concern that research in stem cell
biology might lead to human reproductive cloning. Dr. Daley will recount
the history of the stem cell debate and highlight the controversial
questions concerning embryonic and adult stem cells, and therapeutic
versus reproductive cloning.

   Abstract = {Context Considerable concern has been generated in the lay and medical communities by a theory that increased measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) immunization among young children may be the cause of an apparent marked increase in autism occurrence. Objective To determine if a correlation exists in secular trends of MMR immunization coverage among young children and autism occurrence. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective analyses of MMR immunization coverage rates among children born in 1980-1994 who were enrolled in California kindergartens (survey samples of 600-1900 children each year) and whose school immunization records were reviewed to retrospectively determine the age at which they first received MMR immunization; and of autism caseloads among children born in these years who were diagnosed with autism and were enrolled in the California Department of Developmental Services regional service center system. Main Outcome Measures Measles-mumps-rubella immunization coverage rates as of ages 17 months and 24 months and numbers of Department of Developmental Services system enrollees diagnosed with autism, grouped by year of birth. Results Essentially no correlation was observed between the secular trend of early childhood MMR immunization rates in California and the secular trend in numbers of children with autism enrolled in California's regional service center system. For the 1980-1994 birth cohorts, a marked, sustained increase in autism case numbers was noted, from 44 cases per 100000 live births in the 1980 cohort to 208 cases per 100000 live births in the 1994 cohort (a 373% relative increase), but changes in early childhood MMR immunization coverage over the same time period were much smaller and of shorter duration. Immunization coverage by the age of 24 months increased from 72% to 82%, a relative increase of only 14%, over the same time period. Conclusions These data do not suggest an association between MMR immunization among young children and an increase in autism occurrence.},

   Journal = {Lancet},
   Volume = {349},
   Number = {9044},
   Pages = {14-16},
   Abstract = {Background Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) has been associated with several infectious agents, and the possibility that the disorder may be caused by vaccination has been raised. We compared the numbers of cases of GBS observed immediately after mass measles vaccination campaigns with the numbers that would be expected from baseline rates, to assess whether there is a causal relation between measles vaccination and GBS. Methods We analysed data on 2296 cases of GBS reported to the Poliomyelitis Eradication Surveillance System of the Pan American Health Organization as cases of suspected poliomyelitis. These cases occurred among 73 million immunised children aged 9 months to 15 years in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia, between January, 1990, and December, 1994. These children were targeted for mass measles vaccination compaigns (each lasting 1 month) in 1992 and 1993. The frequency of GBS cases observed during the Vaccination campaigns or the next 42 days (the latent period) was compared with that during the rest of the study period, with the assumption of a Poisson distribution. Findings The average annual incidence of GBS was 0.62 per 100 000 children aged 1-14 years. The number of cases that would be expected within any 72-day period would therefore be 92. The average observed number of cases during latent periods after measles vaccination was 97. The probability that 97 or more cases would occur during a period with an expected number of 92 was 0.31. Interpretation The average annual rates of GBS by age-group for the 5 years analysed were consistent with previous data; thus we are confident that the surveillance system is sufficiently sensitive. There was no statistically significant association between measles vaccination and GBS. If there is any causal relation, the number of GBS cases due to measles vaccination was so small that data from the vaccination of more than 70 million children were not sufficient to detect a rise in the number of observed GBS cases beyond the expected number.},

   Abstract = {A large number of experimental studies have been performed over the past decade in an attempt to develop a vaccine for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These studies have used a variety of approaches aimed at stimulating both antibody-mediated and cell-mediated immunity. Many of these experiments have been performed in macaque models of HIV. Analysis and modeling of the results of these studies provide the opportunity to investigate the mechanisms and limitations of viral control by humoral and cell-mediated immunity. These studies suggest that CD8(+) T cells do 'too little too late' to prevent the establishment of viral infection and latency. By contrast, passively administered antibody acts extremely early to reduce the initial inoculum and slow viral growth. In both cases, reduction in peak viral load appears crucial to the maintenance of CD4(+) T cells in acute infection and for effective long-term viral control. The insights gained from studies of simian human immunodeficiency virus infection have important implications for HIV vaccination. However, important questions remain as to whether differences in pathogenesis in HIV will lead to different 'rules of engagement' for immune control of virus.},

   Abstract = {The results of the present study provide a striking demonstration of antibody orientation produced by the dominant antigens of the strains of influenza virus encountered at childhood. The homologous and heterologous antibody response to monovalent vaccines containing swine, PR8, FM1, or Cuppett viruses show that the antibody-forming mechanisms of children born after 1943 are oriented to strains of influenza A-prime; of recruits to strains of influenza A; and of persons over 30 years of age to a strain of swine influenza. It was shown that antibody response to heterotypic viruses appears to provide a serologic index of the amount of experience each of the segments of the general population studied have had with antigenic variants of influenza virus. Finally it was demonstrated that the antibody response of humans to strains of influenza A or influenza A-prime is remarkably uniform for isolates of each antigenic type.},

   Title = {The abudance threshold for plague as a critical percolation phenomenon},
   Journal = {Nature},
   Volume = {454},
   Pages = {634-637},
   Abstract = {Percolation theory is most commonly associated with the slow 
flow of liquid through a porous medium, with applications to 
the physical sciences. Epidemiological applications have been 
anticipated for disease systems where the host is a plant or volume 
of soil, and hence is fixed in space. However, no natural examples 
have been reported. The central question of interest in percolation 
theory, the possibility of an infinite connected cluster, corre- 
sponds in infectious disease to a positive probability of an epi- 
demic. Archived records of plague (infection with Yersinia 
pestis) in populations of great gerbils (Rhombomys opimus) in 
Kazakhstan have been used to show that epizootics only occur 
when more than about 0.33 of the burrow systems built by the 
host are occupied by family groups. The underlying mechanism 
for this abundance threshold is unknown. Here we present evid- 
ence that it is a percolation threshold, which arises from the dif- 
ference in scale between the movements that transport infectious 
fleas between family groups and the vast size of contiguous land- 
scapes colonized by gerbils. Conventional theory predicts that 
abundance thresholds for the spread of infectious disease arise 
when transmission between hosts is density dependent such that 
the basic reproduction number (R0) increases with abundance, 
attaining 1 at the threshold. Percolation thresholds, however, 
are separate, spatially explicit thresholds that indicate long-range 
connectivity in a system and do not coincide with R0 5 1. 
Abundance thresholds are the theoretical basis for attempts to 
manage infectious disease by reducing the abundance of suscep- 
tibles, including vaccination and the culling of wildlife. This 
first natural example of a percolation threshold in a disease system 
invites a re-appraisal of other invasion thresholds, such as those 
for epidemic viral infections in African lions (Panthera leo), and of 
other disease systems such as bovine tuberculosis (caused by 
Mycobacterium bovis) in badgers (Meles meles). },

   Number = {5},
   Pages = {865-872},
   Abstract = {Evidence of the influence of research on health policy is paradoxical. While there is scant evidence that research has had any impact on the direction or implementation of widespread health reforms, research on evidence-based medicine has dramatically increased, despite limited evidence that it has affected clinical practice. These developments have occurred in the context of a general decline in stale intervention and provision and a post-modern questioning of researchers' authority. Models of the relationship between research and policy range from,ne where empirical research rationally informs decision-making, through research incrementally affecting policy, to an ''enlightenment'' or ''infiltration'' model, which may operate on a conceptual level. Health research that contributes to large-scale socio-political change may require more methodological pluralism and greater focus on key institutional structures. Case studies reviewed suggest that dissemination is enhanced if researchers involve managers and policy-makers in the development of the Framework for and focus of research and if investigators assume a responsibility for seeing their research translated into policy. Public health research is more influential if topical, timely, well-funded and carried out by a collaborative team that includes academics. Evaluations are more influential if, in addition, they are commissioned by health authorities but based on local collection of data, and instruments and incentives to implement policy are available. In some areas, such as the recent policy focus on carers in the community, researchers were largely responsible for raising this policy issue, whereas in other areas, such as the relationship between unemployment and health, researchers are just one of the groups of experts making competing claims about causality. in conclusion, clear research findings are not always a passport to policy, but researchers can reframe the way health policy issues are seen, and collaboration with policy-makers initially can enhance implementation later.

   Abstract = {A mathematical model is presented that explores the relationship between transmission patterns and the evolution of virulence for horizontally transmitted parasites when only a single parasite strain can infect each host. The model is constructed by decomposing parasite transmission into two processes, the rate of contact between hosts and the probability of transmission per contact. These transmission rate components, as well as the total parasite mortality rate, are allowed to vary over the course of an infection. A general evolutionarily stable condition is presented that partitions the effects of virulence on parasite fitness into three components: fecundity benefits, mortality costs. and morbidity costs. This extension of previous theory allows us to explore the evolutionary consequences of a variety of transmission patterns. I then focus attention on a special case in which the parasite density remains approximately constant during an infection, and I demonstrate tw!  o important ways in which transmission modes can affect virulence evolution: by imposing different morbidity costs on the parasite and by altering the scheduling of parasite reproduction during an infection. Both are illustrated with examples. including one that examines the hypothesis that vector-borne parasites should be more virulent than non-vector-borne parasites (Ewald 1994). The validity of this hypothesis depends upon the way in which these two effects interact, and it need not hold in general.},

The model assumes that competition for resources occurs within groups of a finite number of individuals (interaction groups), and that limited dispersal of individuals between groups (according to Wright's island model of population structure) results in genetic structuring of the population. It is found that both finite-sized interaction groups and limited dispersal can have substantial effects on the evolution of resource exploitation strategies as compared to models with a single, infinitely large, well-mixed interaction group. Both effects, in general, tend to select for less aggressive competitive strategies. Moreover, both effects also tend to reduce the likelihood of the evolutionary diversification of resource exploitation strategies that often occurs in models of resource competition with infinite populations. The results are discu!  ssed in the context of theories of the evolutionary diversification of resource exploitation strategies and speciation.},

   Pages = {1317-1323},
   Abstract = {Smallpox causes roughly 20% mortality whereas chickenpox causes less than 0.1%. Most 'verbal' (i.e. non-mathematical) discussions using a mortality definition of virulence would therefore label smallpox as more virulent. Indeed, the virulence of many diseases is measured using such case mortalities, chi, or related measures such as expected host lifespan, T, or lethal dose, LDx. But chi, T and LDx are only indirectly related to parasite-induced instantaneous mortality rate, alpha, which is the mortality measure used in much of the theory developed to explain virulence evolution. Here I point out that relatively deadly pathogens can actually have lower values of alpha than benign pathogens, demonstrating that alpha does not, by itself, reflect the extent to which a parasite causes host mortality. I present mathematical relationships between alpha and chi, T and LDx, and use these to demonstrate that predictions about virulence evolution can be qualitatively altered dependi!  ng upon which measure is used as the definition of virulence. Two simple examples are presented to illustrate this point, one of which demonstrates that the well-cited prediction that virulence should evolve to be higher when disease-independent host mortality increases need not hold. This prediction has been made in terms of parasite-induced instantaneous mortality, alpha, but if virulence is measured using case mortality (or T or LDx) then this prediction can easily be reversed. Theoretical and empirical researchers must use compatible mortality measures before a productive exchange between the two can take place, and it is suggested that case mortality (or lethal dose) is best suited as a single (mortality) measure of parasite virulence.},

Indeed, some data do conform to this general pattern. Nevertheless, his hypothesis has generated some debate about the extent to which it is valid. I explore this issue quantitatively within the framework of mathematical epidemiology. In particular, I present a dynamic optimization model for the evolution of parasite replication strategies that explicitly explores the validity of this hypothesis. A few different model assumptions are explored and it is found that Ewald's hypothesis has only qualified support as a general explanation for why vector-borne parasites are more virulent than those that are directly transmitted. I conclude by suggesting that an alternative explanation might lie in differences in inoculum size between these two types of transmission. (C) 2!  002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

   Abstract = {Many pathogens produce resilient free-living propagules that allow their dissemination in the absence of direct contact between susceptible and infected hosts. One might expect pathogens capable of producing such long-lived propagules to evolve high levels of virulence because their reproductive success is de-coupled from the survival of their host. Despite some comparative data supporting this prediction, theory has questioned its general validity. I present theoretical results that incorporate two transmission routes neglected by previous theory: death-mediated propagule production and direct host- host transmission. This theory predicts that spore-producing pathogens should evolve high levels of virulence under quite broad conditions. Moreover, a novel prediction of this theory is that the production of propagules can generate selection for the evolution of pathogen characteristics such as toxins whose sole function is to kill the host. This latter result reveals an un!  anticipated mechanism through which virulence is expected to evolve in spore-producing pathogens.},

I use reasoning from theory about the evolution of senescence, to suggest that differences in the relative timing of transmission and virulence can generate strong selective forces that shape virulence evolution.

   Abstract = {Some of the best empirical examples of life-history evolution involve responses to predation. Nevertheless, most life-history theory dealing with responses to predation has not been formulated within an explicit dynamic food-web context. In particular, most previous theory does not explicitly consider the coupled population dynamics of the focal species and its predators and resources. Here we present a model of life- history evolution that explores the evolutionary consequences of size-specific predation on small individuals when there is a trade-off between growth and reproduction. The model explicitly describes the population dynamics of a predator, the prey of interest, and its resource. The selective forces that cause life-history evolution in the prey species emerge from the ecological interactions embodied by this model and can involve important elements of frequency dependence. Our results demonstrate that the strength of the coupling between predator and prey in !  the community determines many aspects of life- history evolution. If the coupling is weak (as is implicitly assumed in many previous models), differences in resource productivity have no effect on the nature of life-history evolution. A single life-history strategy is favored that minimizes the equilibrium resource density (if possible). If the coupling is strong, then higher resource productivities select for faster growth into the predation size refuge. Moreover, under strong coupling it is also possible for natural selection to favor an evolutionary diversification of life histories, possibly resulting in two coexisting species with divergent life-history strategies.},

emergence of pandemic inﬂuenza strains remain incompletely understood. Here, we develop a stochastic 
model for the evolutionar y emergence of pandemic inﬂuenza, and use it to address three main questions. 
(i) What is the minimum annual number of avian inﬂuenza virus infections required in humans to explain 
the historical rate of pandemic emergence? (ii) Are such avian inﬂuenza infections in humans more likely to 
give rise to pandemic strains if they are driven by repeated cross-species introductions, or by low-level 
transmission of avian inﬂuenza viruses between humans? (iii) What are the most effective inter ventions for 
reducing the probability that an inﬂuenza strain with pandemic potential will evolve? Our results suggest 
that if evolutionar y emergence of past pandemics has occurred primarily through viral reassortment in 
humans, then thousands of avian inﬂuenza virus infections in humans must have occurred each year for the 
past 250 years. Analyses also show that if there is epidemiologically signiﬁcant variation among avian 
inﬂuenza virus genotypes, then avian virus outbreaks stemming from repeated cross-species transmission 
events result in a greater likelihood of a pandemic strain evolving than those caused by low-level 
transmission between humans. Finally, public health interventions aimed at reducing the duration of avian

Both species exhibited morphological plasticity in an adaptive direction: each species more closely resembled the other when raised on the latter's diet. Dietreversal reduced the natural morphological gap between these two species, -1% to 58%, depending on the trait. One species is known to have a more variable diet in the wild than the other species, and we found that it also e!  xhibited the greater amount of morphological plasticity. Given that the two species have recently diverged, this result is compelling evidence that diet variability is important in the evolution of plastic trophic morphology.

   Abstract = {In this article we explore how host survival and fecundity are affected by host-parasite coevolution. We examine a situation in which hosts upon being infected can mount a defensive response to clear the infection, but in which there is a fecundity cost to such immunological up-regulation. We also suppose that the parasite exploits the host and thereby causes an elevated host mortality rate. We determine the coevolutionary stable strategies of the parasite's level of exploitation and the host's level of up-regulation, and illustrate the patterns of reduced host fitness (i.e., virulence) that these produce. We find that counterintuitive patterns of virulence are often expected to arise as a result of the interaction between coevolved host and parasite strategies. In particular, despite the fact that the parasite imposes only a mortality cost on the host, coevolution by the host results in a pattern whereby infected hosts always have the same probability of death from infec!  tion, but they vary in the extent to which their fecundity is reduced. This contrasts with previous results and arises from our inclusion of two important factors absent from previous theory: costs of immunological up-regulation and a more suitable measure of parasite-induced mortality.},

Different degrees of morphological and behavioural change were induced using two prey items commonly found in the diet of this species, allowing us to estimate the relative importance of each type of plasticity. The purpose of the experiment was twofold. First, earlier work had suggested that diet variability might be an important factor in the evolution of tropic morphological plasticity in sticklebacks. The present results extend this work by revealing the adaptive significance of morphological plasticity. The current experiment also qualitatively assessed the compatibility of the time scale of morphological change with that of the natural resource variability experienced by this species. The results indicate that diet-induced plasticity improves foraging effici!  ency continuously for up to 72 days of prey exposure. This is probably due in part to plasticity of the external trophic morphology but our results also suggest a complex interplay between morphology and behaviour. The time scale appears to be matched to that of natural diet variability although it is possible that some traits exhibit non-labile plasticity. Our discussion highlights the important distinction between conditions favouring the evolution of labile versus non-labile plasticity. The second objective of the experiment was to determine the relative importance of morphological and behavioural plasticity. Few studies have attempted to quantify the adaptive significance of morphological plasticity and no study to our knowledge has separated the effects of morphological and behavioural plasticity. Our experiment reveals that both behavioural and morphological plasticity are important and it also suggests a dichotomy between the two: behavioural plasticity predominately!   affects searching efficiency whereas morphological plasticity predomi nately affects handling efficiency.},

   Abstract = {Most theory on the evolution of virulence is based on a game- theoretic approach. One potential shortcoming of this approach is that it does not allow the prediction of the evolutionary dynamics of virulence. Such dynamics are of interest for several reasons: for experimental tests of theory, for the development of useful virulence management protocols, and for understanding virulence evolution in situations where the epidemiological dynamics never reach equilibrium and/or when evolutionary change occurs on a timescale comparable to that of the epidemiological dynamics. Here we present a general theory similar to that of quantitative genetics in evolutionary biology that allows for the easy construction of models that include both within-host mutation as well as superinfection and that is capable of predicting both the short- and long-term evolution of virulence. We illustrate the generality and intuitive appeal of the theory through a series of examples showing how it ca!  n lead to transparent interpretations of the selective forces governing virulence evolution. It also leads to novel predictions that are not possible using the game- theoretic approach. The general theory can be used to model the evolution of other pathogen traits as well.},

   Journal = {American Naturalist},
   Volume = {159},
   Number = {4},
   Pages = {338-350},
   Abstract = {It is quite common in studies of life-history plasticity to find a negative relationship between the age at which various life-history transitions occur and the growth conditions under which individuals develop. In particular, high growth typically results in earlier transitions, often at a larger size. Here, we use a relatively general optimization model for age and size at life-history transitions to argue that current life-history theory cannot adequately explain these results. Specifically, most such theory requires key assumptions that are unlikely to be generally met. This suggests that some important component of the biology of many organisms must be missing from many of the models in life-history theory. We suggest that this missing component might be the phenomenon of developmental thresholds. There are at least two different types of developmental thresholds possible, and we incorporate these into our general optimality model to demonstrate how they can cause a !  negative relationship between growth conditions and age at a transition. If developmental thresholds are common throughout taxa, then this might explain the empirical results. Our model formulation and analysis also formalizes the popular Wilbur-Collins hypothesis for age and size at metamorphosis in amphibians. The results demonstrate that optimal combinations of age and size, and the slope of the reaction norm connecting them, depend on the existence and type of threshold assumed. Our results also provide an evolutionary framework that can be used to view the data and many of the proximate submodels derived from the Wilbur-Collins hypothesis.},

These generalizations involve an interesting, dynamic version of Hamilton's Rule from inclusive fitness theory.

In this article we present a generalized maximum principle that includes the effects of interactions among relatives and we show that a time-dependent (dynamic) version of Hamilton's rule holds involving the Hamiltonian.

   Abstract = {In intrademic selection models, individuals interact in groups, and this interaction phase is usually treated as a point in time. It is likely, however, that interactions take place over some time period. If selfishness is treated as a quantitative trait and this time period is explicitly considered, how does the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) level of selfishness or altruism change through time? Our main result is that, under biologically reasonable conditions, the ESS level of selfishness is expected to increase. Tire of the assumptions behind this result are that there is a finite time horizon on the life of the group and that reproduction occurs continuously throughout the time period in question. If there is no time horizon or if all reproductive output is concentrated at the end of the time period, the ESS level of selfishness is constant. Our main result suggests that care must be taken when interpreting empirical data that is collected at different limes and!   that altruism will often be most pronounced when groups first form. The model also demonstrates that, when individuals interact repeatedly over time, the evolution of altruism can be promoted through a mechanism other than reciprocity.},

   Abstract = {Mathematical models of tumor-immune interactions provide an analytic framework in which to address specific questions about tumor-immune dynamics. We present a new mathematical model that describes tumor-immune interactions, focusing on the role of natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells in tumor surveillance, with the goal of understanding the dynamics of immune-mediated tumor rejection. The model describes tumor-immune cell interactions using a system of differential equations. The functions describing tumor-immune growth, response, and interaction rates, as well as associated variables, are developed using a least-squares method combined with a numerical differential equations solver. Parameter estimates and model validations use data from published mouse and human studies. Specifically, CD8+ T-tumor and NK-tumor lysis data from chromium release assays as well as in vivo tumor growth data are used. A variable sensitivity analysis is done on the model. The new functional forms developed show that there is a clear distinction between the dynamics of NK and CD8+ T cells. Simulations of tumor growth using different levels of immune stimulating ligands, effector cells, and tumor challenge are able to reproduce data from the published studies. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the variable to which the model is most sensitive is patient specific, and can be measured with a chromium release assay. The variable sensitivity analysis suggests that the model can predict which patients may positively respond to treatment. Computer simulations highlight the importance of CD8+ T-cell activation in cancer therapy.},

These system characteristics are useful not only to gain a broad understanding of the specific system dynamics, but also to help guide the development of combination therapies. Numerical simulations of mixed chemo-immuno and vaccine therapy using both mouse and human parameters are presented. We illustrate situations for which neither chemotherapy nor immunotherapy alone are sufficient to control tumor growth, but in combination the therapies are able to eliminate the entire tumor.

   Abstract = {Recent experimental studies by Diefenbach et al. [1] have brought to light new information about how the immune 
system of the mouse responds to the presence of a tumor. In the Diefenbach studies, tumor cells are modiﬁed to 
express higher levels of immune stimulating NKG2D ligands. Experimental results show that sufﬁciently high levels of 
ligand expression create a signiﬁcant barrier to tumor establishment in the mouse. Additionally, ligand transduced tumor 
cells stimulate protective immunity to tumor rechallenge. Based on the results of the Diefenbach experiments, we have 
developed a mathematical model of tumor growth to address some of the questions that arise regarding the mechanisms 
involved in the immune response to a tumor challenge. The model focuses on the interaction of the NK and CD8+ T 
cells with various tumor cell lines using a system of differential equations. We propose new forms for the tumor-immune 
competition terms, and validate these forms through comparison with the experimental data of [1].},

   Abstract = {Many people voluntarily incur costs to punish violations of social norms. Evolutionary models and empirical evidence indicate that such altruistic punishment has been a decisive force in the evolution of human cooperation. We used (H2O)-O-15 positron emission tomography to examine the neural basis for altruistic punishment of defectors in an economic exchange. Subjects could punish defection either symbolically or effectively. Symbolic punishment did not reduce the defector's economic payoff, whereas effective punishment did reduce the payoff. We scanned the subjects' brains while they learned about the defector's abuse of trust and determined the punishment. Effective punishment, as compared with symbolic punishment, activated the dorsal striatum, which has been implicated in the processing of rewards that accrue as a result of goal-directed actions. Moreover, subjects with stronger activations in the dorsal striatum were willing to incur greater costs in order to punish. Our findings support the hypothesis that people derive satisfaction from punishing norm violations and that the activation in the dorsal striatum reflects the anticipated satisfaction from punishing defectors.},

These campaigns have been followed by improvements in routine vaccination services and in surveillance systems, so that the progress of the measles elimination efforts can be sustained and monitored. follow-up mass vaccination campaigns for children younger than 5 years are planned to take place every 3 to 5 years.},

However, this costly and unrealistic scenario is not necessary to ensure elimination. more appropriately defined as a situation in which sustained transmission cannot occur and secondary spread from importations of disease will end naturally, without intervention. The authors describe the size and duration of outbreaks caused by imported infections after indigenous transmission has been eliminated. They show that the status of the elimination process can be monitored by assessing the proportion of cases imported and the distribution of outbreak sizes; Measles in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom provides a good example of the:relevance of these criteria. Surveillance of the size and duration of these outbreaks enables maintenance of elimination to be monitored.},

   Abstract = {Was the mortality associated with the deadliest known epidemic in human history, the Balck Death of 1347-1351, selective with respect to preexisting health conditions ("frailty")? Many researchers have assumed that the Black Death was so virulent, and the European population so immunologically naive, that the epidemic killed indiscriminately, irrespective of age, sex, or frailty. If this were true, Black Death cemeteries would provide unbiased cross-sections of demographic and epidemiological conditions in 14th century Europe. Using skeletal remains from medieval England and Denmark, new methods of paleodemographic age estimation, and a recent multistate model of selective mortality, we test the assumption that the mid-14th century Black Death killed indiscriminately. Skeletons from the East Smithfield Black Death cemetary in London are compared with normal, non-epidemic cemetary samples from two medieval Danish towns (Viborg and Odense). The results suggest that the Black Death did not kill indiscriminately - that it was, in fact, selective with respect to frailty, although probably not as strongly selective as normal mortality.},

We studied the dynamics of replicate laboratory metapopulations of Drosophila under different migration rates. Low migration stabilized metapopulation dynamics, while promoting unstable subpopulation dynamics, by inducing asynchrony among neighboring subpopulations. High migration synchronized subpopulation dynamics, thereby destabilizing the metapopulations. Contrary to some theoretical predictions, increased migration did not affect average population size. Simulations based on a simple non–species-specific population growth model captured most features of the data, which suggests that our results are generalizable.},

   Abstract = {MATCONT is a graphical MATLAB software package for the interactive numerical study of dynamical systems. It allows one to compute curves of equilibria, limit points, Hopf points, limit cycles, period doubling bifurcation points of limit cycles, and fold bifurcation points of limit cycles. All curves are computed by the same function that implements a prediction- correction continuation algorithm based on the Moore-Penrose matrix pseudo-inverse. The continuation of bifurcation points of equilibria and limit cycles is based on bordering methods and minimally extended systems. Hence no additional unknowns such as singular vectors and eigenvectors are used and no artificial sparsity in the systems is created. The sparsity of the discretized systems for the computation of limit cycles and their bifurcation points is exploited by using the standard Matlab sparse matrix methods. The MATLAB environment makes the standard MATLAB Ordinary Differential Equations ( ODE) Suite interactively available and provides computational and visualization tools; it also eliminates the compilation stage and so makes installation straightforward. Compared to other packages such as AUTO and CONTENT, adding a new type of curves is easy in the MATLAB environment. We illustrate this by a detailed description of the limit point curve type.},

   Abstract = {Extrapair paternity has been the focus of numerous studies of socially monogamous birds, but the dynamics of extrapair male- female interactions have been explored in relatively few. In western bluebirds (Sialia mexicana), a species with 20% extrapair paternity, two to four observers monitored extrapair copulations (EPCs) occurring on the female's home territory while her social mate was detained in a cage near the nest. Detention elevated the frequency and visibility of EPCs, so we could score receptivity of females to identifiable extrapair males without the interference of intermale aggression. Most intruding extrapair males were neighboring breeders visiting outside their own mate's fertile period. Local male relatives of the detained male attempted nonincestuous EPCs, but neighboring sons did not attempt to copulate with their mothers and, in some cases, chased away intruders. Female receptivity was not influenced by whether the detained mate was visually present or hidden behind cloth and did not increase with the persistence or relative size of the extrapair male. Female receptivity increased with the age difference between the extrapair male and the female's social mate, suggesting that females prefer older males as extrapair partners. This study suggests that costs of resistance are relatively unimportant in determining female receptivity in western bluebirds, but identifies preferential receptivity to older males as a potential factor in the outcome of inter- and intrasexual conflict over paternity.},

   Abstract = {The seminal paper by Daniel Bernoulli published in 1766 is put into a new perspective. After a short 
account of smallpox inoculation and of Bernoulli’s life, the motivation for that paper and its impact are 
described. It determines the age-speciﬁc equilibrium prevalence of immune individuals in an endemic potentially lethal infectious disease. The gain in life expectancy after elimination of this cause of death can be explicitly expressed in terms of the case fatality and the endemic prevalence of susceptibles. D’Alembert developed in 1761 an alternative method for dealing with competing risks of death, which is also applicable to non-infectious diseases. Bernoulli’s formula for the endemic prevalence of susceptibles has so far escaped attention. It involves the lifetime risk of the infection, the force of infection and the life expectancy at birth. A new formula for the basic reproduction number is derived which involves the average force of infection, the average case fatality and the life expectancy at the time of infection. One can use this estimate to assess the gain in life expectancy if only a fraction of the population is immunized. },

   Abstract = {Replication-competent viruses are being tested as tumor therapy agents. The fundamental premise of this therapy is the selective infection of the tumor cell population with the amplification of the virus. Spread of the virus in the tumor ultimately should lead to eradication of the cancer. Tumor virotherapy is unlike any other form of cancer therapy as the outcome depends on the dynamics that emerge from the interaction between the virus and tumor cell populations both of which change in time. We explore these interactions using a model that captures the salient biological features of this system in combination with in vivo data. Our results show that various therapeutic outcomes are possible ranging from tumor eradication to oscillatory behavior. Data from in vivo studies support these conclusions and validate our modeling approach. Such realistic models can be used to understand experimental observations, explore alternative therapeutic scenarios and develop techniques to optimize therapy. },

We propose a "resilience hypothesis," which suggests two levels of causal influences on birth seasonality.

   Journal = {American Naturalist},
   Volume = {156},
   Pages = {S77-S101},
   Abstract = {Evolutionary branching occurs when frequency-dependent selection splits a phenotypically monomorphic population into two distinct phenotypic dusters. A prerequisite for evolutionary branching is that directional selection drives the population toward a fitness minimum in phenotype space. This article demonstrates that selection regimes leading to evolutionary branching readily arise fi-om a nide variety of different ecological interactions within and between species. We use classical ecological models for symmetric and asymmetric competition, for mutualism, and for predator-prey interactions to describe evolving populations with continuously varying characters. For these models, we investigate the ecological and evolutionary conditions that allow for evolutionary branching and establish that branching is a generic and robust phenomenon. Evolutionary branching becomes a model for sympatric speciation when population genetics and mating mechanisms are incorporated into ecological models. In sexual populations with random mating, the continual production of intermediate phenotypes from two incipient branches prevents evolutionary branching. In contrast, when mating is assortative for the ecological characters under study, evolutionary branching is possible in sexual populations and can lead to speciation. Therefore, we also study the evolution of assortative mating as a quantitative character. We show that evolution under branching conditions selects for assortativeness and thus allows sexual populations to escape from fitness minima. We conclude that evolutionary branching offers a general basis for understanding adaptive speciation and radiation under a wide range of different ecological conditions.},

   Pages = {1761-1766},
   Abstract = {Background Health authorities worldwide, especially in the Asia Pacific region, are seeking effective public-health interventions in the continuing epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We assessed the epidemiology of SARS in Hong Kong. Methods We included 1425 cases reported up to April 28, 2003. An integrated database was constructed from several sources containing information on epidemiological, demographic, and clinical variables. We estimated the key epidemiological distributions: infection to onset, onset to admission, admission to death, and admission to discharge. We measured associations between the estimated case fatality rate and patients' age and the time from onset to admission. Findings After the initial phase of exponential growth, the rate of confirmed cases fell to less than 20 per day by April 28. Public-health interventions included encouragement to report to hospital rapidly after the onset of clinical symptoms, contact tracing for confirmed and suspected cases, and quarantining, monitoring, and restricting the travel of contacts. The mean incubation period of the disease is estimated to be 6.4 days (95% CI 5.2-7.7). The mean time from onset of clinical symptoms to admission to hospital varied between 3 and 5 days, with longer times earlier in the epidemic. The estimated case fatality rate was 13.2% (9.8-16.8) for patients younger than 60 years and 43.3% (35.2-52.4) for patients aged 60 years or older assuming a parametric gamma distribution. A non-parametric method yielded estimates of 6.8% (4.0-9.6) and 55.0% (45.3-64.7), respectively. Case clusters have played an important part in the course of the epidemic. Interpretation Patients' age was strongly associated with outcome. The time between onset of symptoms and admission to hospital did not alter outcome, but shorter intervals will be important to the wider population by restricting the infectious period before patients are placed in quarantine.},

   Abstract = {Study objective: To determine whether acetaminophen affects the duration or
severity of childhood varicella.
Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
Setting: Office- and hospital-based pediatric practices.
Patients: Seventy-two children between I and 12 years of age entered the study.
One child was withdrawn because of high fever, and three children did not
complete the study; 31 received placebo and 37 received acetaminophen.
Interventions: Acetaminophen, 10 mg/kg/dose, was given at 8 AM, 12 PM, 4 PM,
and 8 PM for 4 days. Placebo was given to the control group. Itching, appetite,
activity, and overall condition were measured for 6 days. The time to last
vesicle formation, time to total scabbing, and time to total healing were
measured until complete resolution of the exanthem.
Measurements and main results: The following results were better in the
placebo group (p <.05): time to total scrabbing 5.6 days (SD 2.5) versus 6.7 days
(SD 2.3) in the acetaminophen group, and itching on day 4 in the placebo
group (symptom score 2.9 [SD 0.20] vs 2.2 (SD 0.26]). Activity was better in the
acetaminophen group on day 2 (3.13 [SD 0.23] vs 2.82 [SD 0.24]).
Conclusions: These results provide evidence that acetaminophen does not
alleviate symptoms in children with varicella and may prolong illness. },

   Abstract = {Current textbooks Link influenza pandemics to influenza A virus subtypes H2 (1889-91), H3 (1900), H1 (1918-20), H2 (1957-58) and H3 (1968), a pattern suggesting subtype recycling in humans. Since H1 reappeared in 1977, whatever its origin, some workers feel that H2 is the next pandemic candidate. This report reviews the publications on which the concept of influenza A virus subtype recycling is based and concludes that the data are inconsistent with the purported sequence of events. The three influenza pandemics prior to 1957-58 were linked with subtypes through retrospective studies of sera from the elderly, or through seroarchaeology. The pandemic seroarchaeological model for subtype H1 has been validated by the recent recovery of swine virus RNA fragments from persons who died from influenza in 1918. Application of the model to pre-existing H3 antibody among the elderly links the H3 subtype to the pandemic of 1889-91, not that of 1900 as popularly quoted. Application of the model to pre-existing H2 antibody among the elderly fails to confirm that this subtype caused a pandemic in the late 1800s, a finding which is consistent with age-related excess mortality patterns during the pandemics of 1957 (H2) and 1968 (H3). H2 variants should be included in pandemic planning for a number of reasons, but not because of evidence of recycling. It is not known when the next pandemic will occur or which of the 15 (or more) haemagglutinin subtypes will be involved. Effective global surveillance remains the key to influenza preparedness.},

   Abstract = {The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus caused severe disease and heavy economic losses before apparently coming under complete control. Our understanding of the forces driving seasonal disappearance and recurrence of infectious diseases remains fragmentary, thus limiting any predictions about whether, or when, SARS will recur. It is true that most established respiratory pathogens of human beings recur in wintertime, but a new appreciation for the high burden of disease in tropical areas reinforces questions about explanations resting solely on cold air or low humidity. Seasonal variation in host physiology may also contribute. Newly emergent zoonotic diseases such as ebola or pandemic strains of influenza have recurred in unpredictable patterns. Most established coronaviruses exhibit winter seasonality, with a unique ability to establish persistent infections in a minority of infected animals. Because SARS coronavirus RNA can be detected in the stool of some individuals for at least 9 weeks, recurrence of SARS from persistently shedding human or animal reservoirs is biologically plausible.},

   Abstract = {Symplectic maps (canonical transformations) are treated from the Lie algebraic point of view using Lie series and Lie algebraic techniques.  It is shown that under very general conditions an analytic symplectic map can be written as a product of Lie transformations.  Under certain conditions this product of Lie transformations can be combined to form a single Lie transformation by means of the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff theorem.  This result leads to invariant functions and generalizes to several variables a classic result of Birkhoff for the case of two variables.  It also provides a new approach since the connection between symplectic maps, Lie algebras, invariant functions, and Birkhoff's work has not been previously recognized and exploited.  It is expected that the results obtained will be applicable to the normal form problem in Hamiltonian mechanics, the use of Poincar\'e section map in stability analysis, and the behavior of magnetic field lines in a toroidal plasma device.},

   Abstract = {BACKGROUND The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has recently been identified as a new clinical entity. SARS is thought to be caused by an unknown infectious agent. METHODS Clinical specimens from patients with SARS were searched for unknown viruses with the use of cell cultures and molecular techniques. RESULTS A novel coronavirus was identified in patients with SARS. The virus was isolated in cell culture, and a sequence 300 nucleotides in length was obtained by a polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR)-based random-amplification procedure. Genetic characterization indicated that the virus is only distantly related to known coronaviruses (identical in 50 to 60 percent of the nucleotide sequence). On the basis of the obtained sequence, conventional and real-time PCR assays for specific and sensitive detection of the novel virus were established. Virus was detected in a variety of clinical specimens from patients with SARS but not in controls. High concentrations of viral RNA of up to 100 million molecules per milliliter were found in sputum. Viral RNA was also detected at extremely low concentrations in plasma during the acute phase and in feces during the late convalescent phase. Infected patients showed seroconversion on the Vero cells in which the virus was isolated. CONCLUSIONS The novel coronavirus might have a role in causing SARS.},

   Abstract = {Traditionally, the termination of parasite epidemics has been attributed to ecological causes: namely, the depletion of susceptible hosts as a result of mortality or acquired immunity. Here, we suggest that epidemics can also end because of rapid host evolution. Focusing on a particular host-parasite system, Daphnia dentifera and its parasite Metschnikowia bicuspidata, we show that Daphnia from lakes with recent epidemics were more resistant to infection and had less variance in susceptibility than Daphnia from lakes without recent epidemics. However, our studies revealed little evidence for genetic variation in infectivity or virulence in Metschnikowia. Incorporating the observed genetic variation in host susceptibility into an epidemiological model parameterized for this system reveals that rapid evolution can explain the termination of epidemics on time scales matching what occurs in lake populations. Thus, not only does our study provide rare evidence for parasite-mediated selection in natural populations, it also suggests that rapid evolution has important effects on short-term host-parasite dynamics.},

   Abstract = {We present a dynamic model to examine sequential foraging decisions of predators searching for cryptic prey. We identify key elements of information processing and ecological factors determining the costs and benefits of two foraging alternatives. On the one hand, specializing on a single prey type while ignoring other types increases the distance a forager must move; this involves increased energy and time expenditures. On the other hand, switching between searching for several prey types has the obvious cost of an initial reduction in the probability of detecting prey immediately after switching. Switching also has the less apparent cost of a forager's reduced ability to assess the probability of prey presence. We show that if the cost of switching is sufficiently high, and a forager estimates that one prey type is more common than others, then the forager should search for this prey only, unless conditions change.},

   Abstract = {We present spatially explicit models to predict the optimal distribution of numerous food provisioners that share a nesting aggregation. We compare predictions for solitary and social provisioners, and for three foraging currencies. When distinct food patches with identical food parameters are considered, fewer provisioners use the farther patches. The rate of decline in number of provisioners depends on the currency used. With net rate of energy intake (net energy gain over time), the rate of decline is relatively small under a wide range of realistic parameter values and distances; with efficiency (net energy gain over energy cost) and empirically derived energetic costs, the rate of decline is much higher. With lifetime fitness (lifetime food delivery under predation risk), outcomes depend on the ratio of mortality risk during flight and during food collection at the patch. With all currencies, there is a difference between the optimal spatial distribution of solitary and social provisioners, with a larger proportion of social provisioners being farther from the central place. The optimal distribution of solitary provisioners in a two dimensional field of uniformly distributed food such as a flowering meadow is such that the density of solitary provisioners (number per unit area) declines monotonically with distance, and provisioner number peaks at half the maximum area used.

   Journal = {Journal of Social Policy},
   Volume = {31},
   Pages = {39-59},
   Abstract = {Although the policy network approach has moved to the forefront of the debates around the formulation and development of policy, there is a paucity of methodological and reflexive literature which explores how policy networks and the actors within these arenas are actually studied. Researching powerful individuals within such networks generates a unique set of dilemmas and complexities for the researcher. Drawing on my experiences of researching the policy networks involved in the development of prison drugs policy, this paper provides a methodological and reflexive account of the key processes and issues involved in my research. In particular, it explores the political dimensions of the research problem and the importance of switching the research gaze from the 'objects' of policy to those who are in the powerful positions of 'making' policy. In order to understand the interactions within the policy process, it is argued that the qualitative approach offers distinct advantages in studying policy networks. The paper examines my attempts to uncover and understand the role and influence of policy networks in the development of prison drugs policy and the ways in which I grappled with the dilemmas of access, knowledge and power which emerged during the course of the fieldwork. Although the importance of transparent methodologies and reflexivity are highlighted, the paper concludes by suggesting that the resistance on the part of researchers to providing such accounts is related to the pressures and constraints of the current academic climate.},

Mathematical models are developed which include the growth of the population and the death rate from scarlet fever. Time-series analysis of the results shows that there were two distinct phases to the disease (i) 1848-1880: regular epidemics (wavelength = 3.7 years) consistent with the system being driven by an oscillation in the transmission coefficient (delta beta) at its resonant frequency, probably associated with dry conditions in winter (ii) 1880-1900: an undriven SEIR system with a falling endemic level and decaying epidemics. This period was associated with improved nutritive levels. There is also evidence from time-series analysis that raised wheat prices in pregnancy caused increased susceptibility in the subsequent children. The pattern of epidemics and the demographic characteristics of the population can be replicated in the modelling which provides insights into the detailed epidemiology of scarlet fever in this community in the 19th century.},

The interepidemic period was found to be two years in London and five years in Penrith. Equations governing the dynamics of epidemics predict 1) a two-year periodicity and 2) that oscillatory epidemics die out quickly. It is suggested that epidemics were maintained by a periodic variation in susceptibility linked either to a five-year cycle of malnutrition or to an annual cycle.

The oscillations (epidemics) persisted for over 150 years and it is suggested that both systems were pumped up by regular fluctuations in susceptibility (delta beta). Modelling suggests that: (i) the natural frequency of oscillations in large cities is two years and the system is pumped up by a 1 year, seasonal input; (ii) it takes five years to build up a pool of susceptibles in medium-sized towns by new births and epidemics are then triggered by a 5 year input. The equations represent a system that has two components, a basic linear element with the remainder of the system being nonlinear; modelling a progressive increase in delta beta in London illustrates theoretically how a predominantly linear response changes to a nonlinear response and ultimately to chaos. A variation in susceptibility is a theoretical condition for inducing chaos; the undriven system cannot become chaotic. Modelling populations of progressively increasing size/density and applying a I year or 5 year sinusoidal oscillation in delta beta illustrates the fundamental distinction in the response of medium-sized rural towns and large cities.},

   Abstract = {Time series analysis of the London Bills of Mortality, 1701-1812, reveals that whooping cough appeared as a lethal endemic disease after 1700 with epidemics of progressively increasing amplitude after 1720. The interepidemic period changed from 5 years (1720-1750) to 3 years (1750-1785) before returning to 5 years during 1785-1812. The epidemiology of whooping cough can be described by the mathematics of linearized dynamic systems and the interepidemic interval is determined by population size and susceptibility. The latter was governed by fluctuating levels of malnutrition, which were directly associated with oscillations in the wheat prices. It is suggested that the epidemics were driven in 1720-1785 by fluctuating seasonal temperatures which interacted with oscillations in wheat prices to produce an oscillation in susceptibility, but after 1785 the dynamics escaped from the pattern predicted by mathematical theory and the epidemics were apparently driven only by the wheat prices which generated a regular oscillation in susceptibility. The results emphasize the importance of an adequate nutritive level in combating whooping cough in the Third World today where it remains a lethal disease in children because of immunodeficiency linked to fluctuating and severe malnutrition which is often a consequence of crop cycles.},

   Abstract = {The evolution of smallpox epidemics in London, 1647-1893, was studied by time series analysis of deaths from the disease in the Bills of Mortality. The interepidemic interval (T) evolved progressively from 4 years to 2 years at 1800. The dynamics of epidemics during 1647-1800 are explicable in terms of the transmission of viral diseases which shows that (i) T is determined by the product of population size (N) and susceptibility (beta), (ii) T determines the mean age of catching the disease, (iii) the system will settle at its steady-state, endemic level unless the epidemics are driven. It is suggested that (i) the progressive change in T was initially caused by a rise in N and later by an increased beta related to malnutrition and (ii) the epidemics were driven by an oscillation in delta beta associated with seasonal dry conditions. The effects of variolation and vaccination became apparent after 1800: the endemic level fell progressively, the epidemics were reduced in amplitude and they were not driven. The dynamics of the disease can now be described by an SEIR model: severe outbreaks of smallpox are followed by decaying epidemics. Endemic smallpox mortality also interacts with the dynamics of the population so that a long wavelength oscillation (associated with recovery after the plague) and a 5/6 year (associated with immigration) oscillation are generated.

The dynamics of the scarlet fever epidemics can be represented by a linearized mathematical model and because the system is lightly damped, it could be driven by an oscillation in susceptibility. Epidemics were significantly correlated with dry conditions in spring/summer (P < 0.001), suggesting that these produced a low amplitude oscillation in susceptibility which drove the system. Epidemics also correlated (P < 0.001) with an oscillation in wheat prices but at a lag of 3 years, suggesting that malnutrition during pregnancy caused increased susceptibility in the subsequent children which interacted synergistically with seasonal dry conditions. Scarlet fever mortality was sharply reduced after 1880 in parallel with falling wheat prices suggesting that the remarkable period of high scarlet fever mortality (1840-80) was dependent on poor nutritive levels during that time.},

   Abstract = {The last fifteen years have seen a reemergence of interest in cancer immunosurveillance and a broadening of this concept into one termed cancer immunoediting. The latter, supported by strong experimental data derived from murine tumor models and provocative correlative data obtained by studying human cancer, holds that the immune system not only protects the host against development of primary nonviral cancers but also sculpts tumor immunogenicity. Cancer immunoediting is a process consisting of three phases: elimination (i.e., cancer immunosurveillance), equilibrium, and escape. Herein, we summarize the data supporting the existence of each of the three cancer immunoediting phases. The full understanding of the immunobiology of cancer immunosurveillance and immunoediting will hopefully stimulate development of more effective immunotherapeutic approaches to control and/or eliminate human cancers. },

A protracted polemic resulted, with contributions by Kersseboom, Maitland and Sussmilch. The latter ended the controversy by showing that the population of London could not be estimated from the annual average of births, nor that of Paris from the annual average of deaths. In the meantime, London had in fact taken the lead, experiencing a strong growth between 1666 and 1728.},

It explicitly or implicitly underlies many models of biodiversity of competing species, as well as non-spatial or metapopulation models of persistence of individual species. The model has also been used to study persistence in simple disease models. The stochastic logistic model has direct relevance for questions of limiting similarity in ecological systems. This paper uses a biased random walk heuristic to derive a scaling relationship for the persistence of a population under this model, and discusses its implications for models of biodiversity and persistence. Time to extinction of a species under the stochastic logistic model is approximated by the exponential of the scaling quantity U=(R-1)(2) N/R(R+1), where N is the habitat size and R is the basic reproductive number.

   Abstract = {Many diseases show important interactions between epidemiology and immunology. Both models and data suggest that epidemiologically controlled variables, like frequency and intensity of exposure, can affect immunological outcomes in a wide variety of diseases. Conversely, the results of the immunological ''battle'' between host and parasite determine the ability of the parasite to spread. I present a simple model with two possible states of infection, which assumes that higher exposure to infection is correlated with likelihood of acquiring a more severe infection. For some parameter values, this model leads to simultaneous stability of the disease-free equilibrium and an endemic equilibrium, implying that the disease might be able to persist in a population that it could not invade. I also derive a simple and interpretable sufficient condition for multiple stable states. The ''cartoon'' model presented here shows that interaction between epidemiology and immunology can have important effects on the invasion and persistence of diseases. In particular, it raises the possibility that this mechanism can lead to mathematical ''catastrophe'' and to long-term cycles in disease prevalence. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited},

   Abstract = {This paper investigates the possibility of understanding the effects of host heterogeneity on disease levels through the use of moment approximations. The approach is to avoid assumptions about the distribution of mixing rates (or other parameters) in the population, by treating the low-order moments of the distribution as estimable parameters. This approach, while approximate, can greatly reduce the number of parameters needed to explore the effects of population heterogeneity on disease dynamics. This makes the approach useful for both inference and prediction, and also for gaining insight into the qualitative effects of heterogeneity on the spread of disease. This paper focuses on populations with variations in mixing rate and random mixing. It is shown that moment-based approximations can provide good quantitative estimates of disease dynamics, as well as aiding in qualitative understanding, over a respectable range of parameters, It is hoped that this approach will provide a useful complement to more traditional box models of heterogeneity.

   Journal = {Health Technology Assessment},
   Volume = {14},
   Number = {34},
   Pages = {279-+},
   Abstract = {Background: Mathematical models, based on data describing normal patterns of social mixing, are used to understand epidemics in order to predict patterns of disease spread and plan interventions and responses. However, individuals who are ill show behavioural changes that affect their social mixing patterns and predictive models should take into account these changes if they are to be effective.
Objectives: To describe and quantify the changes in (1) social contact behaviour experienced by individuals when they are ill with pandemic H1N1 influenza (swine flu) and (2) mixing patterns of school children that take place as a result of swine flu-related school closures.
Methods: For the first part of the study, a self-completed questionnaire-based study was carried out in the autumn/winter of 2009-10. The study population was individuals who had been diagnosed with swine flu and who received a swine flu antiviral prescription from an antiviral distribution centre (ADC). It consisted of an initial survey to be filled in when participants were symptomatic with swine flu and a follow-up survey to be filled in when they had recovered. Each part of the questionnaire had two sections: patient details and a contact diary. The second part of the study was adapted to quantify the difference in mixing patterns of pupils between the school term and the half-term holiday as school closures did not occur during the study period. Eight schools participated and questionnaire packs were distributed to them, containing two surveys: one to be filled in during the school term and one during the spring half-term holiday.
Results: For the patient study, approximately 3800 surveys were distributed by 31 ADCs. Overall, 317 responses to the initial survey were received and 179 participants returned the follow-up survey. For all types of a contact, except contacts made at home, there were highly significant differences in contact behaviour (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.001). Individuals made substantially fewer contacts when they were ill than when they were well. Analysis showed that returning to work was the most significant predictor of increased numbers of contacts. Also, the greater the change in the number of symptoms reported, the greater the change in the number of contacts. For the school study, approximately 1100 questionnaire packs were distributed and 134 responses were received, with 119 paired contact diaries. Pupils reported on average 18.51 contacts each day during term time and 9.24 during the half-term holiday a reduction of over 50\% and a highly significant change (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.0001).
Conclusions: The evidence from this study suggests that ill individuals make substantial changes to their social contact patterns. These changes are strongly linked to absence from work and the severity of the reported illness. Epidemiological modellers should therefore consider the implications of illness-related behavioural changes on model predictions. Future studies to measure the extent of behavioural change in a broader cross-section of infected cases could be valuable, along with more detailed studies of the social contact patterns of school children, focusing on differences between school terms and school holidays.},

In this paper several modeling approaches to reduce the physical complexity and, hence, accelerate the computation are compared. They range from a mere reduction of dimensionality by lumping the problem along a secondary flow direction to global mass balances or empirical correlations, at the core of which a one-dimensional boundary value problem must be solved. It is found that even strongly simplified models can describe the qualitative behaviour of the model with regard to variations in the geometrical and hydrodynamic model parameters quite well. In order to obtain also quantitatively reliable results the hydrodynamics must be considered in an appropriate manner.},

   Pages = {635-650},
   Abstract = {Data on the pre-vaccination patterns of infection for measles, mumps and rubella are collated from a number of European countries in order to compare the epidemiology of the three viruses. Key epidemiological parameters, such as the age- specific force of infection and the basic reproduction number (R-o) are estimated from case notification or serological data using standard techniques. A method is described to compare force of infection estimates derived from serological data. Analysis suggests that the pre-vaccination patterns of measles and mumps infection in the different countries were similar. In contrast, the epidemiology of rubella was highly variable between countries. This suggests that it may be acceptable to use parameter values estimated from other countries to model measles and mumps transmission, but that this approach to modelling rubella transmission requires more caution. Estimates of R-o depend on underlying mixing assumptions. Constraints were placed on R-o estimates by utilising knowledge of likely mixing patterns. The estimates for R-o were highest for measles, intermediate for mumps, and generally lowest for rubella. Analysis of within- and between-age-group transmission rates suggested that mumps transmission tends to be more concentrated within young children than the other two viruses. The implications for the design of immunization programmes are that mumps may be the easiest to control via infant immunization since it is predominantly transmitted between the very young and the variability in rubella epidemiology requires that careful consideration of the possible effects of vaccination options should be made using local data when planning rubella immunization programmes.},

   Pages = {617-634},
   Abstract = {The prevention of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), as a complication of rubella infection during pregnancy, is the main aim of rubella vaccination programmes. However, as vaccination of infants leads to an increase in the average age at which those who were not immunized become infected, certain rubella vaccination programmes can lead to an increase in the incidence of CRS. In this paper we use a mathematical model of the transmission dynamics of rubella virus to investigate the likely impact of different Vaccination policies in Europe. The model was able to capture pre-and post-vaccination patterns of infection and prevalence of serological markers under a wide variety of scenarios, suggesting that the model structure and parameter estimates were appropriate. Analytical and numerical results suggest that endemic circulation of rubella is unlikely in Finland, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, and perhaps Denmark, provided vaccine coverage is uniform across geographical and social groups. In Italy and Germany vaccine coverage in infancy has not been sufficient to interrupt rubella transmission, and continued epidemics of CRS seem probable. It seems unlikely that the immunization programmes in these countries are doing more harm than good, but this may be partly as a result of selective immunization of schoolgirls. Indeed, in both these countries, selective Vaccination of schoolgirls with inadequate vaccination histories is likely to be an important mechanism by which CRS incidence is suppressed (unlike the other countries, which have had sufficiently high infant coverage rates to withdraw this option). Reducing inequalities in the uptake of rubella vaccine may bring greater health benefits than increasing the mean level of coverage.},

The TIM-2 in vitro model of the human intestine was inoculated with a GI tract microbiota resembling that of the small intestine, to which subsequently 4, 20 or 40 mM of [U-C-13]-glucose were added. RNA was extracted from lumen samples after 0 (control), 1, 2 and 4 h and subjected to density-gradient ultracentrifugation. Phylogenetic analysis of unlabeled 16S rRNA revealed a microbial community dominated by lactic acid bacteria and Clostridium perfringens. Distinct C-13-incorporation into bacterial RNA was only observed for the 40-mM addition. 16S rRNA fingerprinting showed an activity drop of Lactobacillus fermentum after glucose addition, while Streptococcus bovis and C. perfringens were identified as the most active glucose-fermenters. Accordingly, NMR analysis identified lactate, acetate, butyrate and formate as the principal fermentation products, constituting up to 91% of the C-13-carbon balance. RNA-SIP combined with metabolic profiling allowed us to detect differential utilization of a general model carbohydrate, indicating that this approach holds great potential to identify bacteria involved in the fermentation of dietary relevant oligo- and polymeric carbohydrates in the human intestine.},

   Pages = {748--766},
   Abstract = {The $(U,V,W)$-velocity vectors for 221 well-observed dwarf stars have been used to compute the eccentricities and angular momenta of the galactic orbits in a model galaxy.  It is shown that the eccentricity and the observed ultraviolet excess are strongly correlated.  The stars with the largest excess (i.e., lowest metal abundance) are invariably moving in highly elliptical orbits, whereas stars with little or no excess move in nearly circular orbits.  Correlations also exist between the ultraviolet excess and the $W$-velocity.  Finally, the excess and the angular momentum are correlated; stars with large ultraviolet excesses have small angular momenta.
These correlations are discussed in terms of the dynamics of a collapsing galaxy.  The data require that the oldest stars were formed out of gas falling  toward the galactic center in the radial direction and collapsing from the halo onto the plane.  The collapse was very rapid and only a few times $10^8$ years were required for the gas to attain circular orbits in equilibrium (i.e., gravitational attraction balanced by centrifugal acceleration).  The scale of the collapse is tentatively estimated to be at least 10 in the radial direction and 25 in the $Z$-direction.  The initial contraction must have begun near the time of formation of the first stars, some $10^{10}$ years ago.},

   Abstract = {There is still limited understanding of key determinants of spatial spread of influenza. The 1918 pandemic provides an opportunity to elucidate spatial determinants of spread on a large scale.
To better characterize the spread of the 1918 major wave, we fitted a range of city-to-city transmission models to mortality data collected for 246 population centres in England and Wales and 47 cities in the US. Using a gravity model for city-to-city contacts, we explored the effect of population size and distance on the spread of disease and tested assumptions regarding density dependence in connectivity between cities. We employed Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to estimate parameters of the model for population, infectivity, distance and density dependence. We inferred the most likely transmission trees for both countries.
For England and Wales, a model that estimated the degree of density dependence in connectivity between cities was preferable by deviance information criterion comparison. Early in the major wave, long distance infective interactions predominated, with local infection events more likely as the epidemic became widespread. For the US, with fewer more widely dispersed cities, statistical power was lacking to estimate population size dependence or the degree of density dependence, with the preferred model depending on distance only. We find that parameters estimated from the England and Wales dataset can be applied to the US data with no likelihood penalty.},

   Journal = {Critical Care},
   Volume = {16},
   Number = {1},
   Abstract = {Introduction: Fever is frequently observed in critically ill patients. An independent association of fever with increased mortality has been observed in non-neurological critically ill patients with mixed febrile etiology. The association of fever and antipyretics with mortality, however, may be different between infective and non-infective illness.
Methods: We designed a prospective observational study to investigate the independent association of fever and the use of antipyretic treatments with mortality in critically ill patients with and without sepsis. We included 1,425 consecutive adult critically ill patients (without neurological injury) requiring > 48 hours intensive care admitted in 25 ICUs. We recorded four-hourly body temperature and all antipyretic treatments until ICU discharge or 28 days after ICU admission, whichever occurred first. For septic and non-septic patients, we separately assessed the association of maximum body temperature during ICU stay (MAX(ICU)) and the use of antipyretic treatments with 28-day mortality.
Results: We recorded body temperature 63,441 times. Antipyretic treatment was given 4,863 times to 737 patients (51.7\%). We found that treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen independently increased 28-day mortality for septic patients (adjusted odds ratio: NSAIDs: 2.61, P = 0.028, acetaminophen: 2.05, P = 0.01), but not for non-septic patients (adjusted odds ratio: NSAIDs: 0.22, P = 0.15, acetaminophen: 0.58, P = 0.63). Application of physical cooling did not associate with mortality in either group. Relative to the reference range (MAX(ICU) 36.5 degrees C to 37.4 degrees C), MAX(ICU) >= 39.5 degrees C increased risk of 28-day mortality in septic patients (adjusted odds ratio 8.14, P = 0.01), but not in non-septic patients (adjusted odds ratio 0.47, P = 0.11).
Conclusions: In non-septic patients, high fever (>= 39.5 degrees C) independently associated with mortality, without association of administration of NSAIDs or acetaminophen with mortality. In contrast, in septic patients, administration of NSAIDs or acetaminophen independently associated with 28-day mortality, without association of fever with mortality. These findings suggest that fever and antipyretics may have different biological or clinical or both implications for patients with and without sepsis.},

   Abstract = {Developing effective policy for environmental health issues requires integrating large collections of information that are diverse, highly variable, and uncertain. Despite these uncertainties in the science, decisions must be made. These decisions often have been based on risk assessment. We argue that two important features of risk assessment are to identify research needs and to provide information for decision making. One type of information that a model can provide is the sensitivity of making one decision over another on factors that drive public health risk. To achieve this goal, a risk assessment framework must be based on a description of the exposure and disease processes. Regarding exposure to waterborne pathogens, the appropriate framework is one that explicitly models the disease transmission pathways of pathogens. This approach provides a crucial link between science and policy. Two studies-a Giardia risk assessment case study and an analysis of the 1993 Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Cryptosporidium outbreak-illustrate the role that models can play in policy making.},

   Pages = {435-447},
   Abstract = {Pair approximation has frequently proved effective for deriving qualitative information about lattice-based stochastic spatial models for population, epidemic and evolutionary dynamics. Pair approximation is a moment closure method in which the mean-field description is supplemented by approximate equations for the frequencies of neighbor-site pairs of each possible type. A limitation of pair approximation relative to moment closure for continuous space models is that all modes of interaction between individuals (e.g., dispersal of offspring, competition, or disease transmission:) are assumed to operate over a single spatial scale determined by the size of the interaction neighborhood. In this paper I present a multiscale pair approximation which allows different sized neighborhoods for each type of interaction. To illustrate and test the approximation I consider a spatial single-species logistic model in which offspring are dispersed across a birth neighborhood and established individuals have a death rate depending on the population density in a competition neighborhood, with one of these neighborhoods nested inside the other. Analysis of the steady-state equations yields several qualitative predictions that are confirmed by simulations of the model, and numerical solutions of the dynamic equations provide a close approximation to the transient behavior of the stochastic model on a large lattice. The multiscale pair approximation thus provides a useful intermediate between the standard pair approximation for a single interaction neighborhood, and a complete set of moment equations for more spatially detailed models.

   Number = {5},
   Pages = {425-440},
   Abstract = {We present and evaluate an approach to analyzing population dynamics data using semimechanistic models. These models incorporate reliable information on population structure and underlying dynamic mechanisms but use nonparametric surface-fitting methods to avoid unsupported assumptions about the precise form of rate equations. Using historical data on measles epidemics as a case study, we show how this approach can lead to better forecasts, better characterizations of the dynamics, and a better understanding of the factors causing complex population dynamics relative to either mechanistic models or purely descriptive statistical time-series models. The semimechanistic models are found to have better forecasting accuracy than either of the model types used in previous analyses when tested on data not used to fit the models. The dynamics are characterized as being both nonlinear and noisy, and the global dynamics are clustered very tightly near the border of stability (dominant Lyapunov exponent lambda approximate to 0). However, locally in state space the dynamics oscillate between strong short-term stability and strong short-term chaos (i.e., between negative and positive local Lyapunov exponents). There is statistically significant evidence for short-term chaos in all data sets examined. Thus the nonlinearity in these systems is characterized by the variance over state space in local measures of chaos versus stability rather than a single summary measure of the overall dynamics as either chaotic or nonchaotic.},

   Abstract = {Chaos is usually regarded as a distinct alternative to random effects such as environmental fluctuations or external disturbances. We argue that strict separation between chaotic and stochastic dynamics in ecological systems is unnecessary and misleading, and we present a more comprehensive approach for systems subject to stochastic perturbations. The defining property of chaos is sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Chaotic systems are ''noise amplifiers'' that magnify perturbations; nonchaotic systems are ''noise mufflers'' that dampen perturbations. We also present statistical methods for detecting chaos in time-series data, based on using nonlinear time- series modeling to estimate the Lyapunov exponent lambda, which gives the average rate at which perturbation effects grow (lambda > 0) or decay (lambda < 0). These methods allow for dynamic noise and can detect low-dimensional chaos with realistic amounts of data. Results for natural and laboratory populations span the entire range from noise-dominated and strongly stable dynamics through weak chaos. The distribution of estimated Lyapunov exponents is concentrated near the transition between stable and chaotic dynamics. In such borderline cases the fluctuations in short-term Lyapunov exponents may be more informative than the average exponent lambda for characterizing nonlinear dynamics.},

   Abstract = {Nonrandom features of pseudorandom number generators are usually regarded as defects which may be minimized by improving the algorithms or resorting to larger computers.  There are, however, certain elements of order which cannot be avoided even on digital devices of arbitrarily large capacity.  For instance, on an $N$-state machine, pseudorandom number generators will terminate on fixed points or fall into loops after approximately $\sqrt N$ steps.  Combinatorial arguments then can be used to show that for any given algorithm and any finite device it is highly improbable that there are more than three or four distinct terminal loops.  All pseudorandom sequences merging into these loops can be traced backwards to their initial numbers; and the resulting pattern of ``ancestor numbers'' can be charted in detail for any computer, even for noninvertible algorithms.  The conflicting requirements of randomness and finite numerical precision lead to an ordered distribution of the set of initial numbers.  In this sense neither the initial nor the final states of a simulation of chaotic behavior can ever be random.  The ``few loop'' constraint could generate patterns of self-organization in nonequilibrium systems.  Experimental evidence from the hysteresis of Ewing arrays supports this conjecture.},

Twenty- five years ago there was only one, well-defined, concept of stability, universally recognized in the field. In this paper I will try to relate the recent confusion, concerning concepts of population stability, with a more serious, though not that well-recognized, confusion in the modern analytic approach to population dynamics and quantitative evolution. Concepts of population stability will be examined in relation to each other on the one hand and, on the other hand, in relation to two dichotomies regarding the dynamic processes to which they correspond: Short-term versus long-term processes and processes concerning phenotypic changes versus process concerning genotypic changes. A hopefully more consistent use of the current terminology is suggested.},

We find that such an unbeatable strategy is necessarily one in which each individual behaves as if he is related to his neighbors and takes into account their welfare as well as his. The degree to which he cares depends on the radii of his neighborhoods.},

   Abstract = {The family of flattened isochrones is introduced. This comprises a one-parameter sequence of oblate or prolate mass models whose gravitational potential is of Staeckel form in spheroidal coordinates. Properties of the mass model and its projection on the plane of the sky are derived. In the equatorial plane, the potential is exactly that of the isochrone and the orbits are expressible as elementary functions. This is the simplest possible behavior for spheroidal Eddington systems. For the most elementary flattened isochrone, two distinct distribution functions are found. The thin shell model, in which all orbits are infinitesimally thin short-axis tubes, has a distribution function that is an elementary function of the turning points. The Jeans model, in which the distribution function depends only on the classical isolating integrals, the energy and component of angular momentum parallel to the symmetry axis, can be found using integral transform methods. For both models, the equations of stellar hydrodynamics can be simply solved and analytic expressions deduced for the velocity dispersions.},

   Abstract = {The measurements of the possible gravitational microlensing events are analysed with a simple yet accurate disc-halo model of the Milky Way galaxy. This comprises a luminous exponential disc embedded in a flattened dark matter halo with density varying like distance-1.8. The inclusion of a disc has the important effect of lowering the implied masses of the dark matter objects. For the possible detection reported by Alcock et al., the inferred mass of the lens lies in the range ˜0.01-0.15 Msun. The candidate events reported by Aubourg et al. have slightly larger implied masses of ˜0.025-0.35 and ˜0.03-0.45 Msun. These are consistent with the deflectors being either brown dwarfs or low-mass stars. If there is no disc dark matter and the halo is completely composed of baryonic dark objects of typical mass 0.08 M0, the monitoring of 1.8 × 106 stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud will provide at least 8-9 detections a year, in the limit of 100 per cent efficiency.},

   Journal = {Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine},
   Volume = {103},
   Number = {10},
   Pages = {403-411},
   Abstract = {Objective
To determine whether antipyretic treatment for influenza infection influences the risk of mortality in animal models and humans.
Design
A systematic search of Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials was undertaken to identify randomized placebo-controlled trials of antipyretic use in influenza infection in animal models or humans that reported mortality. A quantitative meta-analysis of the risk of death using Peto's one step odds ratio with calculation of the pooled risk of death and standard evaluation of heterogeneity was undertaken.
Setting
Not applicable.
Participants
Not applicable.
Main outcome measures
Risk of mortality associated with antipyretic use in influenza infection.
Results
Eight studies from three publications met the inclusion criteria. No human studies were identified. The risk of mortality was increased by antipyretic use in influenza-infected animals with a fixed effects pooled odds ratio of 1.34 (95\% CI 1.04–1.73). An increased risk was observed with aspirin, paracetamol and diclofenac.
Conclusion
In animal models, treatment with antipyretics for influenza infection increases the risk of mortality. There are no randomized placebo-controlled trials of antipyretic use in influenza infection in humans that reported data on mortality and a paucity of clinical data by which to assess their efficacy. We suggest that randomized placebo-controlled trials of antipyretic use in human influenza infection are urgently required, and that these are sufficiently powered to investigate a potential effect on mortality.},

   Journal = {PLOS Medicine},
   Volume = {5},
   Number = {4},
   Pages = {557-568},
   Abstract = {Background Counties are the smallest unit for which mortality data are routinely available, allowing consistent and comparable long-term analysis of trends in health disparities. Average life expectancy has steadily increased in the United States but there is limited information on long-term mortality trends in the US counties This study aimed to investigate trends in county mortality and cross-county mortality disparities, including the contributions of specific diseases to county level mortality trends. Methods and Findings We used mortality statistics (from the National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS]) and population (from the US Census) to estimate sex-specific life expectancy for US counties for every year between 1961 and 1999. Data for analyses in subsequent years were not provided to us by the NCHS. We calculated different metrics of cross-county mortality disparity, and also grouped counties on the basis of whether their mortality changed favorably or unfavorably relative to the national average. We estimated the probability of death from specific diseases for counties with above- or below-average mortality performance. We simulated the effect of cross-county migration on each county's life expectancy using a time-based simulation model. Between 1961 and 1999, the standard deviation (SD) of life expectancy across US counties was at its lowest in 1983, at 1.9 and 1.4 y for men and women, respectively. Cross-county life expectancy SD increased to 2.3 and 1.7 y in 1999. Between 1961 and 1983 no counties had a statistically significant increase in mortality; the major cause of mortality decline for both sexes was reduction in cardiovascular mortality. From 1983 to 1999, life expectancy declined significantly in 11 counties for men (by 1.3 y) and in 180 counties for women (by 1.3 y); another 48 (men) and 783 (women) counties had nonsignificant life expectancy decline. Life expectancy decline in both sexes was caused by increased mortality from lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and a range of other noncommunicable diseases, which were no longer compensated for by the decline in cardiovascular mortality. Higher HIV/AIDS and homicide deaths also contributed substantially to life expectancy decline for men, but not for women. Alternative specifications of the effects of migration showed that the rise in cross-county life expectancy SD was unlikely to be caused by migration. Conclusions There was a steady increase in mortality inequality across the US counties between 1983 and 1999, resulting from stagnation or increase in mortality among the worst-off segment of the population. Female mortality increased in a large number of counties, primarily because of chronic diseases related to smoking, overweight and obesity, and high blood pressure.},

   Journal = {Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series C-Applied Statistics},
   Volume = {50},
   Pages = {251-283},
   Abstract = {The basic reproduction number of an infection, R-0, is the average number of secondary infections generated by a single typical infective individual in a totally susceptible population. It is directly related to the effort required to eliminate infection. We consider statistical methods for estimating R-0 from age-stratified serological survey data. The main difficulty is indeterminacy, since the contacts between individuals of different ages are not observed. We show that, given an estimate of the average age-specific hazard of infection, a particular leading left eigenfunction is required to specify R-0. We review existing methods of estimation in the light of this indeterminacy. We suggest using data from several infections transmitted via the same route, and we propose that the choice of model be guided by a criterion based on similarity of their contact functions. This approach also allows model uncertainty to be taken into account. It one infection induces no lasting immunity, we show that the only additional assumption required to estimate R-0 is that the contact function is symmetric. When matched data on two or more infections transmitted by the same route are available, the methods may be extended to incorporate the effect of individual heterogeneity. The approach can also be applied in partially vaccinated populations and to populations comprising loosely linked communities. The methods are illustrated with data on hepatitis A, mumps, rubella, parvovirus, Haemophilus influenzae type b and measles infection.},

   Journal = {The Journal Of Hygiene},
   Volume = {56},
   Number = {1},
   Pages = {151-62},
   Abstract = {The  standard  tests  for infectivity  of  influenza  viruses  in eggs  or mice  have  two major shortcomings.  First,  the  host 
systems  are known  to  be inhomogeneous, i.e. the  response  does  not  depend  solely  on the  dose;  and second,  this  variation  from host to host  cannot  be assessed independently, since a single test only can be made on any  one 
egg or mouse. Thus, the two probabilities -- the  presence  of an infective unit  in  the  inoculum  and  the  success  of  a  particular  virus-host  interaction -- are confounded,  so that  we estimate  not the number of infective  units  but  an unknown function  of this  number.  Valid  comparisons  of infectivity can still be made  as long as  one  is  satisfied  with  a  relative  answer,  and  does  not  wish  to inquire into  the nature  of host-resistance. 

In  principle, the  method  could be improved in  either  of  two  ways: if  a  new, uniformly  susceptible  host  be found,  the  problem  of variability  would  vanish;  or, if means were devised to allow replicate tests  on the same host, the variability  could be  estimated independently.  The  first  of these  is  the  high ideal  of virology;  and even  if  it  were  realized,  the  problem  of  interhost  variation  would  not  be solved, merely eliminated.  The  second  approach  appears  more  practical since  there  are promising  precedents,  and, if  succesful,  more  informative  since  it  would give  a direct  measure  of interhost  variation. 

In exploring the latter,  we  built largely on  the  pioneering  work  of  Fulton  & Armitage  (1951). Their experiments showed that fragments  of the  chorio-allantois could be maintained  in a simple medium;  that  these fragments could be infected  by influenza  viruses;  and that  infection  could be readily  recognized by haemagglutination.  However,  their  test  was twenty to eighty times  less  sensitive  than  the standard infectivity test  in eggs.  The  task  of  our study,  then,  was  to  learn  the reasons  for this  lack  of susceptibility  and, if feasible,  to  remove  its  causes. },

Experimental evidence indicates that human altruism is a powerful force and is unique in the animal world. However, there is much individual heterogeneity and the interaction between altruists and selfish individuals is vital to human cooperation. Depending on the environment, a minority of altruists can force a majority of selfish individuals to cooperate or, conversely, a few egoists can induce a large number of altruists to defect. Current gene-based evolutionary theories cannot explain important patterns of human altruism, pointing towards the importance of both theories of cultural evolution as well as gene-culture co-evolution.},

   Abstract = {Human cooperation is an evolutionary puzzle. Unlike other creatures, people frequently cooperate with genetically unrelated strangers, often in large groups, with people they will never meet again, and when reputation gains are small or absent. These patterns of cooperation cannot be explained by the nepotistic motives associated with the evolutionary theory of kin selection and the selfish motives associated with signalling theory or the theory of reciprocal altruism. Here we show experimentally that the altruistic punishment of defectors is a key motive for the explanation of cooperation. Altruistic punishment means that individuals punish, although the punishment is costly for them and yields no material gain. We show that cooperation flourishes if altruistic punishment is possible, and breaks down if it is ruled out. The evidence indicates that negative emotions towards defectors are the proximate mechanism behind altruistic punishment. These results suggest that future study of the evolution of human cooperation should include a strong focus on explaining altruistic punishment.},

A basic reproduction ratio is derived and related to the existence of an endemic equilibrium, to the stability of the disease-free equilibrium, and to weak and strong endemicity ( persistence) of the disease. A characteristic equation is found, the zeros of which determine the local stability of the endemic equilibrium, and sufficient stability conditions are given for the case that infected individuals do not return into the susceptible class. In a subsequent paper, explicit sufficient and necessary stability conditions will be derived for the case that the disease dynamics are much faster than the demographics.},

The model is used to make predictions of future incidence and to simulate the impact of additional control strategies. Hastening the slaughter of animals with suspected infection is predicted to slow the epidemic, but more drastic action, such as "ring" culling or vaccination around;infection foci, is necessary for more rapid control.

   Abstract = {In pandemic and epidemic forms, influenza causes substantial, sometimes catastrophic, morbidity and mortality. Intense selection from the host immune system drives antigenic change in influenza A and B, resulting in continuous replacement of circulating strains with new variants able to re-infect hosts immune to earlier types. This 'antigenic drift'(1) often requires a new vaccine to be formulated before each annual epidemic. However, given the high transmissibility and mutation rate of influenza, the constancy of genetic diversity within lineages over time is paradoxical. Another enigma is the replacement of existing strains during a global pandemic caused by 'antigenic shift'-the introduction of a new avian influenza A subtype into the human population(1). Here we explore ecological and immunological factors underlying these patterns using a mathematical model capturing both realistic epidemiological dynamics and viral evolution at the sequence level. By matching model output to phylogenetic patterns seen in sequence data collected through global surveillance(2), we find that short-lived strain-transcending immunity is essential to restrict viral diversity in the host population and thus to explain key aspects of drift and shift dynamics.},

   Abstract = {Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A viruses are now endemic in avian populations in Southeast Asia, and human cases continue to accumulate. Although currently incapable of sustained human-to-human transmission, H5N1 represents a serious pandemic threat owing to the risk of a mutation or reassortment generating a virus with increased transmissibility. Identifying public health interventions that might be able to halt a pandemic in its earliest stages is therefore a priority. Here we use a simulation model of influenza transmission in Southeast Asia to evaluate the potential effectiveness of targeted mass prophylactic use of antiviral drugs as a containment strategy. Other interventions aimed at reducing population contact rates are also examined as reinforcements to an antiviral-based containment policy. We show that elimination of a nascent pandemic may be feasible using a combination of geographically targeted prophylaxis and social distancing measures, if the basic reproduction number of the new virus is below 1.8. We predict that a stockpile of 3 million courses of antiviral drugs should be sufficient for elimination. Policy effectiveness depends critically on how quickly clinical cases are diagnosed and the speed with which antiviral drugs can be distributed.},

Study Design: Theoretical analysis of ordinary differential equation models for sexually transmitted disease transmission within sex-partner networks. Results: The approach developed advances earlier pair models, allows for the influence of concurrent sexual partnerships, and illustrates the importance of concurrency to the persistence of diseases with relatively short durations of infectiousness. The authors also illustrate that heterogeneity in risk is possible even in model populations in which all individuals follow the same behavioral rules. Conclusion: Deterministic extended pair models offer a powerful approach to modelling sexually transmitted disease transmission that usefully complement computationally intensive microsimulation models.},

   Abstract = {Although vaccination has almost eliminated measles in parts of the world, the disease remains a major killer in some high birth rate countries of the Sahel. On the basis of measles dynamics for industrialized countries, high birth rate regions should experience regular annual epidemics. Here, however, we show that measles epidemics in Niger are highly episodic, particularly in the capital Niamey. Models demonstrate that this variability arises from powerful seasonality in transmission - generating high amplitude epidemics - within the chaotic domain of deterministic dynamics. In practice, this leads to frequent stochastic fadeouts, interspersed with irregular, large epidemics. A metapopulation model illustrates how increased vaccine coverage, but still below the local elimination threshold, could lead to increasingly variable major outbreaks in highly seasonally forced contexts. Such erratic dynamics emphasize the importance both of control strategies that address build- up of susceptible individuals and efforts to mitigate the impact of large outbreaks when they occur.},

   Abstract = {Iron is required by many microorganisms for growth. Although it is the most abundant transition metal on earth, its solubility is very low and therefore its bioavailability is poor. To overcome this limitation, many microorganisms have developed iron chelating mechanisms that enable them to bind the metal to organic molecules from which they are later released. In particular, pseudomonads are prominent producers of the chelator pyoverdine that has a high iron binding capability. We present a mathematical model for pyoverdine production by Pseudomonas fluorescens. It is a nonlinear and non-autonomous system of four ordinary differential equations for the dependent variables size of bacterial population, pyoverdine, dissolved iron and chelated iron. The transient adaptation of the average physiological state of the population to the environmental condition is explicitly included in the model formulation. A complete qualitative description of the model solution is given, based on analytical techniques. The model is quantitatively validated against experimental data of pyoverdine and population size. To this end we conduct and discuss a parameter identification study. It is found that the model, if calibrated using pyoverdine data alone is able to predict the population size and vice versa, with some restrictions. Thus the model can be used as an indirect experimental tool. },

Simulation results for unstructured and structured populations (three stage classes) agree with these calculations.},

   Pages = {603-624},
   Abstract = {Analytical methods for predicting and exploring the dynamics of stochastic, spatially interacting populations have proven to have useful application in epidemiology and ecology. An important development has been the increasing interest in spatially explicit models, which require more advanced analytical techniques than the usual mean-field or mass-action approaches. The general principle is the derivation of differential equations describing the evolution of the expected population size and other statistics. As a result of spatial interactions no closed set of equations is obtained. Nevertheless, approximate solutions are possible using closure relations for truncation. Here we review and report recent progress on closure approximations applicable to lattice models with nearest-neighbour interactions, including cluster approximations and elaborations on the pair (or pairwise) approximation. This study is made in the context of an SIS model for plant-disease epidemics introduced in Filipe and Gibson (1998, Studying and approximating spatio-temporal models for epidemic spread and control, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B 353, 2153-2162) of which the contact process [Harris, T. E. (1974), Contact interactions on a lattice, Ann. Prob. 2, 969] is a special case. The various methods of approximation are derived and explained and their predictions are compared and tested against simulation. The merits and limitations of the various approximations are discussed. A hybrid pairwise approximation is shown to provide the best predictions of transient and long-term, stationary behaviour over the whole parameter range of the model.

   Abstract = {A class of simple spatio-temporal stochastic models for the spread and control of plant disease is investigated. We consider a lattice-based susceptible-infected model in which the infection of a host occurs through two distinct processes: a background infective challenge representing primary infection from external sources, and a short-range :interaction representing the secondary infection of susceptibles by infectives within the population. Recent data-modelling studies have suggested that the above model may describe the spread of aphid-borne virus diseases in orchards. In addition, we extend the model to represent the effects of different control strategies involving replantation (or recovery). The Contact Process is a particular case of this model. The behaviour of the model has been studied using cellular-automata simulations. An alternative approach is to formulate a set of deterministic differential equations that captures the essential dynamics of the stochastic system. Approximate solutions to this set of equations, describing the time evolution over the whole parameter range, have been obtained using the pairwise approximation (PA) as well as the most commonly used mean-field approximation (MF). Comparison with simulation results shows that PA is significantly superior to MF, predicting accurately both transient and long-run, stationary behaviour over relevant parts of the parameter space. The conditions for the validity of the approximations to the present model and extensions thereof are discussed.},

   Abstract = {The interval between successive cases of an infectious disease is determined by the time from infection to infectiousness, the duration of infectiousness, the time from infection to disease onset (incubation period), the duration of any extra-human phase of the infectious agent, and the proportion clinically affected among infected individuals. The interval is important in the interpretation of infectious disease surveillance and trend data, in the identification of outbreaks, and in the optimization of quarantine and contact tracing. This paper discusses the properties of these intervals, as measured between transmission events or between clinical onsets of successive infected individuals, noting the determinants of their ranges and frequency distributions, the circumstances under which secondary cases may arise before primaries, and under which the infection transmission interval will be different from the interval between clinical onsets of successive cases. It discusses the derivation of interval distribution statistics from descriptive data given in standard textbooks, with illustrations from published data on outbreaks, households, and epidemiologic tracing. Finally, it discusses the implications of such measures for studies of secondary attack rates, for the persistence of infection in human communities, for outbreak response, and for elimination or eradication programs.},

   Pages = {243-250},
   Abstract = {Background There is considerable variability in rates of hospitalization of patients with community-acquired pneumonia, in part because of physicians' uncertainty in assessing the severity of illness at presentation.
Methods From our analysis of data on 14,199 adult inpatients with community-acquired pneumonia, we derived a prediction rule that stratifies patients into five classes with respect to the risk of death within 30 days. The rule was validated with 1991 data on 38,039 inpatients and with data on 2287 inpatients and outpatients in the Pneumonia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) cohort study. The prediction rule assigns points based on age and the presence of coexisting disease, abnormal physical findings (such as a respiratory rate of greater than or equal to 30 per minute or a temperature of greater than or equal to 40 degrees C), and abnormal laboratory findings (such as a pH <7.35, a blood urea nitrogen concentration greater than or equal to 30 mg per deciliter [11 mmol per liter] or a sodium concentration <130 mmol per liter) at presentation.
Results There were no significant differences in mortality in each of the five risk classes among the three cohorts. Mortality ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 percent for class I patients (P=0.22), from 0.6 to 0.7 percent for class II (P=0.67), and from 0.9 to 2.8 percent for class III (P=0.12). Among the 1575 patients in the three lowest risk classes in the Pneumonia PORT cohort, there were only seven deaths, of which only four were pneumonia-related. The risk class was significantly associated with the risk of subsequent hospitalization among those treated as outpatients and with the use of intensive care and the number of days in the hospital among inpatients.
Conclusions The prediction rule we describe accurately identifies the patients with community-acquired pneumonia who are at low risk for death and other adverse outcomes. This prediction rule may help physicians make more rational decisions about hospitalization for patients with pneumonia. (C) 1997, Massachusetts Medical Society.},

Each year the reported incidence reaches its annual low between weeks 36 to 39, very close to the opening of primary schools. Analysis of these data with a simple mass action model reveals that the underlying transmission parameter has had a similar annual pattern in years of major and minor epidemics. The transmission parameter rises three times each year, coinciding with opening of school terms, and falls with school term and mid–term holidays. This pattern of the transmission parameter has been maintained in the decaded since national vaccination began, indicating that the importance of schools in the annual dynamics of measles has not changed. The analysis further suggests that the national measles vaccination programme has not lowered the total number of individuals susceptible to measles in England and Wales.},

   Abstract = {Both the absolute levels and the seasonal pattern of pertussis have changed over the past four decades in England and Wales. Three-to-four-year period epidemics tended to peak in the early or middle part of the year prior to 1957, during the last quarter between 1958 and 1975, and have been bimodal, with peaks in February and September, in both epidemics since 1976. Analysis of reported incidence data reveals similarities in the underlying seasonal pattern of transmission throughout this period. Seasonal effects include an increase in transmission coincident with the opening of schools in September. Other features of the pattern, such as a sharp fall in transmission in late November and a protracted low during February and March, are more difficult to explain, but may indicate important factors in the natural history of pertussis. The bimodality of recent epidemics appears to be a consequence of a seasonal low in transmission during February and March followed by a high level of transmission during the summer months. These seasonal trends may in turn reflect the increasing proportion of cases among pre-school children as a consequence of the fall in vaccine uptake during the mid 1970's.},

We propose the use of a discrete time epidemic model comprising the infected and susceptible class as state variables. The model uses a discrete time version of the susceptible–exposed–infected–recovered type epidemic models, which can be fitted to observed disease incidence time series. We describe a method for reconstructing the dynamics of the susceptible class, which is an unobserved state variable of the dynamical system. The model provides a remarkable fit to the data on case reports of measles in England and Wales from 1944 to 1964. Morever, its systematic part explains the well-documented predominant biennial cyclic pattern. We study the dynamic behaviour of the time series model and show that episodes of annual cyclicity, which have not previously been explained quantitatively, arise as a response to a quicker replenishment of the susceptible class during the baby boom, around 1947.},

The generality of the mechanism is validated in a neuronal model with the same coupling architecture.

   Abstract = {We present and analyze a model for the cross-regulation of the Th1 and Th2 helper cell subsets during an immune response by the regulatory cytokines interferon -y (IFN-y) and interleukin-10 (IL-10). IFN-y, secreted by Th1 cells, can inhibit the proliferation of Th2 cells. Interleukin-10, secreted by Th2 cells, inhibits cytokine production by Th1 cells. Based on these properties, the model shows that responses are expected to be dominated by either Th1 cells or Th2 cells but not both. Which type dominates is shown to depend principally on the relative efficiencies of activation of the responding Th1 and Th2 cells. However, our model, as well as numerous experiments, show that perturbations of the system allow one to switch from a Th2 to a Th1 response, or vice versa. Our model can account for observed outcomes of parasitic infection and may also contribute to our understanding of immune responses to HIV infection as well as to tolerance to self-components. It also predicts that in certain parameter ranges vaccination with low doses of live parasites can provide protection against subsequent encounters with high doses that normally induce disease. Experiments by Bretscher et al. (1992, Science 257, 539) on Leishmania major infection are consistent with this prediction. A similar strategy may also be relevant for the design of an AIDS vaccine. Lastly, our results indicate that Th1/Th2 cross-regulation is capable of generating a "sneaking through" phenomenon, and hence it may play a role in tumor immunity.},

   Abstract = {The T helper (Th) phenotypes, Th1/Th2, are acquired upon interaction of a naive T helper cell and an antigen presenting cell (APC). Naive T helper cells may differentiate into either phenotype, and the actual outcome is determined by the density and avidity of the antigenic determinants presented by the APC, and the APCs inherent costimulatory properties. Until recently it was thought that differentiation is further affected by cytokines. However, Murphy et al. (1996, J. Exp. Med. 183, 901) have demonstrated that the experimental results, formerly interpreted as Th1/Th2 differentiation, in effect comprise an observation of two consecutive processes. (i) An interaction between naive T cells and APC creates a mixture of mature cells irreversibly committed to Th1 or Th2 phenotype. (ii) Subsequent addition of regulatory cytokines, promotes expansion of one phenotype while suppressing the other. The consequent shift in the per culture production of marker cytokines mimics the appearance of a cellular phenotype switch. We present and analyse a mathematical model that extrapolates these experimental facts into systemic behavior during an immune response. Despite the fact that differentiation produces cells of Th1 and Th2 phenotypes with the same receptor speciﬁcity, our results indicate that competition for antigenic stimulation, mediated by the APCs, combines with cytokine mediated cross-suppression between phenotypes to yield a response that is eventually dominated by T helper cells that are uniform in both receptor speciﬁcity (clonotype) and in cytokine secretion phenotype. },

   Journal = {Plos One},
   Volume = {8},
   Number = {12},
   Abstract = {Background: Communicable disease outbreaks of novel or existing pathogens threaten human health around the globe. It would be desirable to rapidly characterize such outbreaks and develop accurate projections of their duration and cumulative size even when limited preliminary data are available. Here we develop a mathematical model to aid public health authorities in tracking the expansion and contraction of outbreaks with explicit representation of factors (other than population immunity) that may slow epidemic growth.
Methodology: The Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (IDEA) model is a parsimonious function that uses the basic reproduction number R-0, along with a discounting factor to project the growth of outbreaks using only basic epidemiological information (e. g., daily incidence counts).
Principal Findings: Compared to simulated data, IDEA provides highly accurate estimates of total size and duration for a given outbreak when R-0 is low or moderate, and also identifies turning points or new waves. When tested with an outbreak of pandemic influenza A (H1N1), the model generates estimated incidence at the i+1th serial interval using data from the ith serial interval within an average of 20% of actual incidence.
Conclusions and Significance: This model for communicable disease outbreaks provides rapid assessments of outbreak growth and public health interventions. Further evaluation in the context of real-world outbreaks will establish the utility of IDEA as a tool for front-line epidemiologists.},

   Abstract = {We studied the evolution of the HA1 domain of the H3 hemagglutinin gene from human influenza virus type A. The phylogeny of these genes showed a single dominant lineage persisting over time. We tested the hypothesis that the progenitors of this single evolutionarily successful lineage were viruses carrying mutations at codons at which prior mutations had helped the virus to avoid human immune surveillance. We found evidence that eighteen hemagglutinin codons appeared to have been under positive selection to change the amino acid they encoded in the past. Retrospective tests show that viral lineages undergoing the greatest number of mutations in the positively selected codons were the progenitors of future H3 lineages in nine of eleven recent influenza seasons. Codons under positive selection were associated with antibody combining sites A or B or the sialic acid receptor binding site. However, not all codons in these sites had predictive value. Monitoring new H3 isolates for additional changes in positively selected codons might help identify the most fit extant viral strains that arise during antigenic drift.},

   Abstract = {We have studied the HA1 domain of 254 human influenza A(H3N2) virus genes for clues that might help identify characteristics of hemagglutinins (HAs) of circulating strains that are predictive of that strain's epidemic potential. Our preliminary findings include the following. (i) The most parsimonious tree found requires 1,260 substitutions of which 712 are silent and 548 are replacement substitutiions. (ii) The HA1 portion of the HA gene is evolving at a rate of 5.7 nucleotide substitutions/year or 5.7 X 10(-3) substitution/site per year. (iii) The replacement substitutions are distributed randomly across the three positions of the codon when allowance is made for the number of ways each codon can change the encoded amino acid. (iv) The replacement substitutions are not distributed randomly over the branches of the tree, there being 2.2 times more changes per tip branch than for non-tip branches. This result is independent of how the virus was amplified (egg grown or kidney cell grown) prior to sequencing or if sequencing was carried out directly on the original clinical specimen by PCR. (v) These excess changes on the tip branches are probably the result of a bias in the choice of strains to sequence and the detection of deterious mutations that had not yet been removed by negative selection. (vi) There are six hypervariable codons accumulating replacement substitutions at an an average rate that is 7.2 times that of the other varied codons. (vii) The number of variable codons in the trunk branches (the winners of the competitive race against the immune system) is 47 +/- 5, significantly fewer than in the twigs (90 +/- 7), which in turn is significantly fewer variable codons than in tip branches (175 +/- 8). (viii) A minimum of one of every 12 branches has nodes at opposite ends representing viruses that reside on different continents. This is, however, no more than would be expected if one were to randomly reassign the continent of origin of the isolates. (ix) Of 99 codons with at least four mutations, 31 have ratios of non-silent to silent changes with probabilities less than 0.05 of occurring by chance, and 14 of those have probabilities <0.005. These observations strongly support positive Darwinian selection. We suggest that the small number of variable positions along the successful trunk lineage, together with knowledge of the codons that have shown positive selection, may provide clues that permit an improved prediction of which strains will cause epidemics and therefore should be used for vaccine production.},

   Abstract = {Few societies, even modern Scandinavian welfare states, avoid the uncomfortable fact of social inequalities in health. In the United Kingdom, ever since accurate mortality data first became available early in the 19th century, life expectancy has been shown to be more favorable for persons in higher-status occupations. Their relative advantages are also enjoyed by their households. Currently, boys born to families with a parent in a professional or managerial occupation can expect to live 5 years longer than a counterpart born to a parent working in a partly skilled or unskilled occupation (1). Similar inequalities in life expectancy prevail in the United States (2, 3). Until recently, the most plausible explana- tion for such inequalities has been that lower-status jobs were associated with lower income, which in turn resulted in damage to the health of an individual and his or her family through poorer diet and housing, lack of access to appropriate health care, and higher levels of social stress. Recently, however, accumulating evidence suggests that such explanations may not be sufficient and that social status itself, regardless of associated material and economic advantages, may confer health benefits.},

   Abstract = {This paper analyses the processes by which organisms form groups and how social forces interact with environmental variability and transport. For aquatic organisms, the latter is especially important—will sheared or turbulent flows disrupt organism groups? To analyse such problems, we use individual-based models to study the environmental and social forces leading to grouping. The models are then embedded in turbulent flow fields to gain an understanding of the interplay between the forces acting on the individuals and the transport induced by the fluid motion. Instead of disruption of groups, we find that flows often enhance grouping by increasing the encounter rate among groups and thereby promoting merger into larger groups; the effect breaks down for strong flows. We discuss the transformation of individual-based models into continuum models for the density of organisms. A number of subtle difficulties arise in this process; however, we find that a direct comparison between the individual model and the continuum model is quite favorable. Finally, we examine the dynamics of group statistics and give an example of building an equation for the spatial and temporal variations of the group-size distribution from the individual-based simulations. These studies lay the groundwork for incorporating the effects of grouping into models of the large scale distributions of organisms as well as for examining the evolutionary consequences of group formation.},

   Journal = {Nature},

   Pages = {714-717},
   Abstract = {Females in a variety of species commonly mate with multiple males, and there is evidence that they benefit by producing offspring of higher genetic quality(1-3); however, the nature of these genetic benefits is debated(1-4). Enhanced offspring survival or quality can result from intrinsic effects of paternal genes- 'good genes'-or from interactions between the maternal and paternal genomes-'compatible genes'(1-5). Evidence for the latter process is accumulating(2,6): matings between relatives lead to decreased reproductive success, and the individual level of inbreeding-measured as average heterozygosity-is a strong fitness predictor(7-13). Females should thus benefit from mating with genetically dissimilar males(2,14). In many birds, social monogamy restricts mate choice, but females may circumvent this by pursuing extra-pair copulations(15,16). Here we show that female blue tits, Parus caeruleus, increase the heterozygosity of their progeny through extra-pair matings. Females thereby produce offspring of higher reproductive value, because less inbred individuals have increased survival chances, a more elaborate male secondary sexual trait (crown colour) and higher reproductive success. The cost of inbreeding may therefore be an important factor driving the evolution of female extra-pair mating.},

   Number = {6},

   Abstract = {Two of the principal explanations for regional population synchrony, largescale environmental variability and dispersal, have received considerable theoretical attention. Although time series analysis has helped to validate the relative importance of these two explanations, very little of this theory has been confirmed by experiment. Here, we demonstrate the dual synchronizing effect of dispersal and temporal environmental variation. We used an experimental model system based on the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus and its algal prey Chlorella vulgaris. We constructed temporal prey fluctuations with two periodic components that matched the generation time and life span of the rotifer. By varying the amplitude of these two periods we created prey variability with "white" (both periods had equal power) and "red" (the longest period had greatest power) spectra. In the absence of dispersal only the red fluctuations induced synchrony in the population dynamics of the rotifer. Dispersal had a strong and rapid synchronizing effect. The combination of red (but not white) fluctuations and dispersal resulted in the highest levels of synchrony. These results confirm the predictions of recent theory, but they also suggest that the temporal structure of environmental variability determines its capacity to synchronize population dynamics over large spatial scales},

   Volume = {78},

   Abstract = {The M2 protein of influenza A virus forms homotetrameric helix bundles, which function as proton-selective channels. The native form of the protein is 97 residues long, although peptides representing the transmembrane section display ion channel activity, which (like the native channel) is blocked by the antiviral drug amantadine. As a small ion channel, M2 may provide useful insights into more complex channel systems. Models of tetrameric bundles of helices containing either 18 or 22 residues have been simulated while embedded in a fully hydrated 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphatidylcholine bilayer. Several different starting models have been used. These suggest that the simulation results, at least on a nanosecond time scale, are sensitive to the exact starting structure. Electrostatics calculations carried out on a ring of four ionizable aspartate residues at the N-terminal mouth of the channel suggest that at any one time, only one will be in a charged state. Helix bundle models were mostly stable over the duration of the simulation, and their helices remained tilted relative to the bilayer normal. The M2 helix bundles form closed channels that undergo breathing motions, alternating between a tetramer and a dimer-of-dimers structure. Under these conditions either the channel forms a pocket of trapped waters or it contains a column of waters broken predominantly at the C-terminal mouth of the pore. These waters exhibit restricted motion in the pore and are effectively "frozen" in a way similar to those seen in previous simulations of a proton channel formed by a four-helix bundle of a synthetic leucine- serine peptide.},

   Abstract = {A two-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations is used to characterize the basic types of phase portraits of the immune system — tumor interactions model, and to study the impact of anti-immune activity by tumor on the outcome of immunotherapy. The focus is on specific (acquired) immunity and different forms of immunotherapy as active therapy with in vivo stimulation of the immunity and passive one with infusion of ex vivo produced specific immunity. The analysis is performed for two families of stimulation function, which describes the dynamics of the stimulation of the immune system 
by tumor antigens: (1) antigen dependent and (2) antigen per one immunity unit dependent functions, with Michaelis-Menten and sigmoid functions in each family. We show that there are no limit cycles in the system and that anti-immune activity by tumor changes all equilibrium points from global to local ones. In the latter case, the immune system has no control over the growth of large tumors. Furthermore,
if the immunity is weak, the immune system cannot eradicate even small tumors. The weak immunity and stimulation strength result in unrestricted tumor growth. The patterns of asymptotic behavior of the system do not depend on the type of the stimulation function, but do depend on its parameters. Our results reflect the basic clinical and experimental knowledge about immunotherapy and its effectiveness and yield new suggestions for an efficient immunotherapy.},

   Journal = {Nature},
   Volume = {431},
   Number = {7009},
   Pages = {693-696},
   Abstract = {Most genes affect many traits(1-4). This phenomenon, known as pleiotropy, is a major constraint on evolution because adaptive change in one trait may be prevented because it would compromise other traits affected by the same genes(2,4). Here we show that pleiotropy can have an unexpected effect and benefit one of the most enigmatic of adaptations-cooperation. A spectacular act of cooperation occurs in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, in which some cells die to form a stalk that holds the other cells aloft as reproductive spores(5,6). We have identified a gene, dimA(7), in D. discoideum that has two contrasting effects. It is required to receive the signalling molecule DIF-1 that causes differentiation into prestalk cells. Ignoring DIF-1 and not becoming prestalk should allow cells to cheat by avoiding the stalk. However, we find that in aggregations containing the wildtype cells, lack of the dimA gene results in exclusion from spores. This pleiotropic linkage of stalk and spore formation limits the potential for cheating in D. discoideum because defecting on prestalk cell production results in an even greater reduction in spores. We propose that the evolution of pleiotropic links between cheating and personal costs can stabilize cooperative adaptations.},

   Abstract = {Four outbreaks of influenza B infection occurred in Houston, Texas in the years 1976-1984. In the Houston Family Study, age-related infection and illness rates in the recent two epidemics resembled those reported previously. A total of 118 persons, including 35 children followed from birth, were followed longitudinally through this entire period and 331 persons were studied through at least two outbreaks. Fifty-nine (88\%) of 67 children studied for four outbreaks were infected and 25\% had a second infection; about half of the adults had one infection but only one of 51 was reinfected. Infection rates were proportionally lower for those followed through 2-3 outbreaks. Those with documented infection were protected decreasingly over time against reinfection and associated illness in subsequent epidemics. Such protection decreased in efficacy from 65\% after 2-3 years, to 46\% after 4-5 years, and to no protection after seven years. },

   Abstract = {To investigate the frequency of natural reinfection with influenza A viruses, 55 children followed from birth along with the 44 other children and 85 adults in their families were observed for varying periods between 1975 and 1981 in the Houston Family Study. Persons infected in 1976 or early 1977 with influenza A subtype H3N2 experienced a high rate of reinfection during the 1977-78 season (63\% in one group of young children) and additional reinfections in 1980-81. Persons in whom H3N2 infection was first observed in 1977-78 had little or no reinfection in 1980-81; one reinfection was observed in 1980-81 among 19 young children at risk. Only one reinfection with influenza A subtype H1N1 was observed following introduction of the virus in early 1978 despite exposure in 1978-80 and a substantial outbreak in 1980-81. Statistically significant protection from reinfection in young children followed from birth was not noted for the 1977-78 H3N2 outbreak but was present in 1979-81 for both H3N2 and H1N1 viruses. Reasons for variations in reinfection suggested by this data include 1) socioeconomic and other factors influencing intensity of exposure, 2) age at primary infection, 3) varying degrees of antigenic difference between sequential variants of a major subtype, and 4) unrecognized immunogenicity or virulence differences between subtypes and variants.},

   Abstract = {Reproduction numbers, defined as averages of the number of people infected by a typical case, play a central role in tracking infectious disease outbreaks. The aim of this paper is to develop methods for estimating reproduction numbers which are simple enough that they could be applied with limited data or in real time during an outbreak. I present a new estimator for the individual reproduction number, which describes the state of the epidemic at a point in time rather than tracking individuals over time, and discuss some potential benefits. Then, to capture more of the detail that micro-simulations have shown is important in outbreak dynamics, I analyse a model of transmission within and between households, and develop a method to estimate the household reproduction number, defined as the number of households infected by each infected household. This method is validated by numerical simulations of the spread of influenza and measles using historical data, and estimates are obtained for would-be emerging epidemics of these viruses. I argue that the household reproduction number is useful in assessing the impact of measures that target the household for isolation, quarantine, vaccination or prophylactic treatment, and measures such as social distancing and school or workplace closures which limit between-household transmission, all of which play a key role in current thinking on future infectious disease mitigation.},

   Abstract = {The aim of this study is to identify general properties of emerging infectious agents that determine the likely success of two simple public health measures in controlling outbreaks, namely (1) isolating symptomatic individuals and (it) tracing and quarantining their contacts. Because these measures depend on the recognition of specific disease symptoms, we investigate the relative timing of infectiousness and the appearance of symptoms by using a mathematical model. We show that the success of these control measures is determined as much by the proportion of transmission occurring prior to the onset of overt clinical symptoms (or via asymptomatic infection) as the inherent transmissibility of the etiological agent (measured by the reproductive number R-0). From published studies, we estimate these quantities for two moderately transmissible viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and HIV, and for two highly transmissible viruses, smallpox and pandemic influenza. We conclude that severe acute respiratory syndrome and smallpox are easier to control using these simple public health measures. Direct estimation of the proportion of asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections is achievable by contact tracing and should be a priority during an outbreak of a novel infectious agent.},

   Abstract = {A novel influenza A (H1N1) virus has spread rapidly across the globe. Judging its pandemic 
potential is difficult with limited data, but nevertheless essential to inform appropriate health 
responses. By analyzing the outbreak in Mexico, early data on international spread, and viral 
genetic diversity, we make an early assessment of transmissibility and severity. Our estimates 
suggest that 23,000 (range 6000 to 32,000) individuals had been infected in Mexico by late April, 
giving an estimated case fatality ratio (CFR) of 0.4% (range: 0.3 to 1.8%) based on confirmed and 
suspected deaths reported to that time. In a community outbreak in the small community of La 
Gloria, Veracruz, no deaths were attributed to infection, giving an upper 95% bound on CFR of 
0.6%. Thus, although substantial uncertainty remains, clinical severity appears less than that seen 
in the 1918 influenza pandemic but comparable with that seen in the 1957 pandemic. Clinical 
attack rates in children in La Gloria were twice that in adults (<15 years of age: 61%; ≥15 years: 
29%). Three different epidemiological analyses gave basic reproduction number (R0) estimates in 
the range of 1.4 to 1.6, whereas a genetic analysis gave a central estimate of 1.2. This range of 
values is consistent with 14 to 73 generations of human-to-human transmission having occurred in 
Mexico to late April. Transmissibility is therefore substantially higher than that of seasonal flu, and 
comparable with lower estimates of R0 obtained from previous influenza pandemics. },

   Abstract = {Human behaviour plays an important role in the spread of infectious diseases, and understanding the influence of behaviour on the spread of diseases can be key to improving control efforts. While behavioural responses to the spread of a disease have often been reported anecdotally, there has been relatively little systematic investigation into how behavioural changes can affect disease dynamics. Mathematical models for the spread of infectious diseases are an important tool for investigating and quantifying such effects, not least because the spread of a disease among humans is not amenable to direct experimental study. Here, we review recent efforts to incorporate human behaviour into disease models, and propose that such models can be broadly classified according to the type and source of information which individuals are assumed to base their behaviour on, and according to the assumed effects of such behaviour. We highlight recent advances as well as gaps in our understanding of the interplay between infectious disease dynamics and human behaviour, and suggest what kind of data taking efforts would be helpful in filling these gaps.},

   Journal = {Virology Journal},
   Volume = {7},
   Number = {1},
   Pages = {52},
   Abstract = {Measles, caused by measles virus (MeV), is a common infection in children. MeV is a member of the genus Morbillivirus and is most closely related to rinderpest virus (RPV), which is a pathogen of cattle. MeV is thought to have evolved in an environment where cattle and humans lived in close proximity. Understanding the evolutionary history of MeV could answer questions related to divergence times of MeV and RPV.
We investigated divergence times using relaxed clock Bayesian phylogenetics. Our estimates reveal that MeV had an evolutionary rate of 6.0-6.5 x 10(-4) substitutions/site/year. It was concluded that the divergence time of the most recent common ancestor of current MeV was the early 20(th) century. And, divergence between MeV and RPV occurred around the 11(th) to 12(th) centuries. The result was unexpected because emergence of MeV was previously considered to have occurred in the prehistoric age.
MeV may have originated from virus of non-human species and caused emerging infectious diseases around the 11(th) to 12(th) centuries. In such cases, investigating measles would give important information about the course of emerging infectious diseases.},

   Abstract = {Insights into the dynamics of a complex system are often gained by focusing on large fluctuations. For the financial system, huge databases now exist that facilitate the analysis of large fluctuations and the characterization of their statistical behaviour(1,2). Power laws appear to describe histograms of relevant financial fluctuations, such as fluctuations in stock price, trading volume and the number of trades(3-10). Surprisingly, the exponents that characterize these power laws are similar for different types and sizes of markets, for different market trends and even for different countries - suggesting that a generic theoretical basis may underlie these phenomena. Here we propose a model, based on a plausible set of assumptions, which provides an explanation for these empirical power laws. Our model is based on the hypothesis that large movements in stock market activity arise from the trades of large participants. Starting from an empirical characterization of the size distribution of those large market participants ( mutual funds), we show that the power laws observed in financial data arise when the trading behaviour is performed in an optimal way. Our model additionally explains certain striking empirical regularities that describe the relationship between large fluctuations in prices, trading volume and the number of trades.},

   Abstract = { The rapid expansion and increasing mobility of human populations make understanding the evolution of parasite virulence a public health priority. The potential for the swift evolution of virulence in response to changes in host ecology has motivated the integration of evolutionary ecology with epidemiological theory, as part of the emerging field of evolutionary epidemiology. Virulence is the product of complex interactions among evolutionary, ecological and epidemiological processes. Recent models that incorporate ideas from both evolutionary ecology and epidemiology generate predictions that could not be made by either discipline alone. These models predict that the ecological or evolutionary changes affecting population dynamics of disease, such as spatial structuring, within-host dynamics, polymorphism in host resistance, host longevity and population size, impose selection on virulence. As disease incidence increases, it becomes particularly important to take into account the implications of infection by multiple parasite strains. Evolutionary epidemic models also identify the potential importance of immune evasion and optimal virulence for the selection of sex in parasites. Thus, merging epidemiology with evolutionary ecology has widespread potential to help us answer evolutionary questions and to guide public health policy.},

The models suggest that uncertainty of future reproductive opportunities should favour withholding of sperm, so that males tend to allocate less (for a given level of stored sperm) earlier in the breeding season. This effect is more pronounced the greater the variance in female quality. We also show that while allocation will be influenced by mate value, it is not necessarily optimal to allocate preferentially to high-quality females, since the benefits of a higher-quality mate may be offset by increased risk of rejection of sperm or higher sperm competition. The relationship between mate quality and level of allocation will depend strongly on the amount of remaining stored sperm, with males whose supplies are depleted being more likely to favour lower-quality partners.},

   Pages = {114-121},
   Abstract = {One of the most popular data sets in ecology, that of lynx fur returns, is analysed in order to look for evidence for a bifurcation process. This bifurcation seems to be present from the observation of sudden shifts in the amplitude of oscillations of the lynx time series. Schaffer first proposed the possibility for such a bifurcation in 1985, and suggested that a possible source for the qualitative change of lynx's fluctuations was an increased trapping effort, which eventually lead to high-amplitude, chaotic dynamics. By studying the available information from the Hudson Bay Company records, we have found evidence for such an increased trapping pressure that (i) rapidly rose close to the shift from low-amplitude to large-amplitude fluctuations around 1820, and (ii) decreased around 1910, when there is another shift again to damped small oscillations. Although an increase in the top-predator mortality in a three-species food web typically leads to simpler dynamics and eventual predator extinction, here we show that a recent model involving a minimum bound in the lynx population, due to the presence of alternative preys in the lynx diet, consistently supports the presence of a bifurcation phenomenon.},

   Abstract = {Over the last two decades, stochastic resonance has continuously attracted considerable attention. The term is given to a phenomenon that is manifest in nonlinear systems whereby generally feeble input information (such as a weak signal) can be be amplified and optimized by the assistance of noise. The effect requires three basic ingredients: (i) an energetic activation barrier or, more generally, a form of threshold; (ii) a weak coherent input (such as a periodic signal); (iii) a source of noise that is inherent in the system, or that adds to the coherent input. Given these features, the response of the system undergoes resonance-like behavior as a function of the noise level; hence the name stochastic resonance. The underlying mechanism is fairly simple and robust. As a consequence, stochastic resonance has been observed in a large variety of systems, including bistable ring lasers, semiconductor devices, chemical reactions, and mechanoreceptor cells in the tail fan of a crayfish. In this paper, the authors report, interpret, and extend much of the current understanding of the theory and physics of stochastic resonance. They introduce the readers to the basic features of stochastic resonance and its recent history. Definitions of the characteristic quantities that are important to quantify stochastic resonance, together with the most important tools necessary to actually compute those quantities, are presented. The essence of classical stochastic resonance theory is presented, and important applications of stochastic resonance in nonlinear optics, solid state devices, and neurophysiology are described and put into context with stochastic resonance theory. More elaborate and recent developments of stochastic resonance theory are discussed, ranging from fundamental quantum properties-being important at low temperatures-over spatiotemporal aspects in spatially distributed systems, to realizations in chaotic maps. In conclusion the authors summarize the achievements and attempt to indicate the most promising areas for future research in theory and experiment.},

   Pages = {1129-1136},
   Abstract = {An aim of some vaccination programmes is to reduce the prevalence of an infectious disease and ultimately to eradicate it. We show that eradication success depends on the type of vaccine as well as on the vaccination coverage. Vaccines that reduce the parasite within-host growth rate select for higher parasite virulence and this evolution may both increase the prevalence of the disease and prevent disease eradication. By contrast, vaccines that reduce the probability of infection select against virulence and may lead more easily to eradication. In some cases, epidemiological feedback on parasite evolution yields an evolutionary bistable situation where, for intermediate vaccination coverage, parasites can evolve towards either high or low virulence, depending on the initial conditions. These results have practical implications for the design and use of imperfect vaccines in public- and animal-health programmes.},

   Abstract = {Pneumonic plague poses a potentially increasing risk to humans in plague nonendemic regions either as a consequence of an aerosolized release or through importation of the disease. Pneumonic plague is person-to-person transmissible. We provide a quantitative assessment of transmissibility based on past outbreaks that shows that the average number of secondary cases per primary case (R-0) was 1.3 (variance = 3.1), assuming a geometric probability distribution, prior to outbreak control measures. We also show that the latent and infectious periods can be approximated by using lognormal distributions with means (SD) of 4.3 (1.8) and 2.5 (1.2) days. Based on this parameter estimation, we construct a Markov-chain epidemic model to demonstrate the potential impact of delays in implementing outbreak control measures and increasing numbers of index cases on the incidence of cases in simulated outbreaks.},

Our results predict that a diverse and noisy community of such genetic oscillators interacting through a quorum-sensing mechanism should self-synchronize in a robust way, leading to a substantially improved global rhythmicity in the system. As such, the particular system of coupled genetic oscillators considered here might be a good candidate to provide the first quantitative example of a synchronization transition in a population of biological oscillators.},

However, the strategy for use of these drugs is still under debate. We evaluated the impact of prophylaxis of healthcare workers (HCWs) through a mathematical model that considers attack rates in a range of 25 35% in the general population and 25 50% among HCWs. Simulations and uncertainty analysis using the demographics of the province of Ontario, Canada show that increasing prophylaxis coverage of HCWs has little impact on reducing the reproduction number of disease transmission and may not prevent the occurrence of an outbreak if expected. However, it does enable a high level of treatment, which substantially reduces morbidity and mortality in the population as a whole. Therefore, prophylaxis of HCWs should be considered an important part of public health efforts for minimizing influenza pandemic burden and its socio-economic disruption.},

   Abstract = {BACKGROUND An outbreak of tuberculosis occurred over a 3-year period in a medium-size community in British Columbia, Canada. The results of mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable-number tandem-repeat (MIRU-VNTR) genotyping suggested the outbreak was clonal. Traditional contact tracing did not identify a source. We used whole-genome sequencing and social-network analysis in an effort to describe the outbreak dynamics at a higher resolution. METHODS We sequenced the complete genomes of 32 Mycobacterium tuberculosis outbreak isolates and 4 historical isolates (from the same region but sampled before the outbreak) with matching genotypes, using short-read sequencing. Epidemiologic and genomic data were overlaid on a social network constructed by means of interviews with patients to determine the origins and transmission dynamics of the outbreak. RESULTS Whole-genome data revealed two genetically distinct lineages of M. tuberculosis with identical MIRU-VNTR genotypes, suggesting two concomitant outbreaks. Integration of social-network and phylogenetic analyses revealed several transmission events, including those involving "superspreaders." Both lineages descended from a common ancestor and had been detected in the community before the outbreak, suggesting a social, rather than genetic, trigger. Further epidemiologic investigation revealed that the onset of the outbreak coincided with a recorded increase in crack cocaine use in the community. CONCLUSIONS Through integration of large-scale bacterial whole-genome sequencing and social-network analysis, we show that a socioenvironmental factor - most likely increased crack cocaine use - triggered the simultaneous expansion of two extant lineages of M. tuberculosis that was sustained by key members of a high-risk social network. Genotyping and contact tracing alone did not capture the true dynamics of the outbreak. (Funded by Genome British Columbia and others.)},

The epidemiology of hepatitis A in countries across the world is changing due to improvements in hygiene and living conditions which reduce the transmissibility of the infection. Methods. A mathematical model is formulated to describe the changes in incidence of a directly transmitted infection produced by a long term decline in its transmissibility. The basic reproduction number, the parameter describing transmissibility, is considered as a function of time. The relationship between the basic reproduction number and the force of infection is derived. Results. Theoretical examples demonstrate that a decline in transmissibility results in an initial decline in the force of infection, but that this may be followed by a substantial resurgence. Resurgences may be possible after several decades of declining incidence, and are most marked following a rapid decline. Conclusions. Countries which have experienced a rapid decline in the incidence of hepatitis A may be at risk of a resurgence. More detailed mathematical models, informed with data from regular age- stratified serological surveys, should provide the basis for decisions on vaccination policy.},

Mathematical models are used to interpret these data and determine whether this increasing susceptibility is sufficient to allow a resurgence of disease from the low levels achieved by 1993. The models summarize serological profiles by a single parameter, the reproduction number R, which quantifies the level of herd immunity in the population. Results showed that there was cause for concern over the levels of susceptibility to measles, with an epidemic of over 100000 cases likely in 1995/6.

Of particular interest is a type of singular strategy that is an evolutionary attractor from a great distance, but once in its neighbourhood a population becomes dimorphic and undergoes disruptive selection leading to evolutionary branching. Modelling the adaptive growth and branching of the evolutionary tree can thus be considered as a major application of the framework. A haploid version of Levene‘s ’soft selection‘ model is developed as a specific example to demonstrate evolutionary dynamics and branching in monomorphic and polymorphic populations.},

   Abstract = {Recent human deaths due to infection by highly pathogenic (H5N1) avian influenza A virus have raised the specter of a devastating pandemic like that of 1917–1918, should this avian virus evolve to become readily transmissible among humans. We introduce and use a large-scale stochastic simulation model to investigate the spread of a pandemic strain of influenza virus through the U.S. population of 281 million individuals for R0 (the basic reproductive number) from 1.6 to 2.4. We model the impact that a variety of levels and combinations of influenza antiviral agents, vaccines, and modified social mobility (including school closure and travel restrictions) have on the timing and magnitude of this spread. Our simulations demonstrate that, in a highly mobile population, restricting travel after an outbreak is detected is likely to delay slightly the time course of the outbreak without impacting the eventual number ill. For R0 < 1.9, our model suggests that the rapid production and distribution of vaccines, even if poorly matched to circulating strains, could significantly slow disease spread and limit the number ill to <10\% of the population, particularly if children are preferentially vaccinated. Alternatively, the aggressive deployment of several million courses of influenza antiviral agents in a targeted prophylaxis strategy may contain a nascent outbreak with low R0, provided adequate contact tracing and distribution capacities exist. For higher R0, we predict that multiple strategies in combination (involving both social and medical interventions) will be required to achieve similar limits on illness rates.},

   Abstract = {The evolutionary biologist "studies the steps by which the miraculous adaptations so characteristic of every aspect of the organic world have evolved''(1). But the general nature of such adaptive steps is still unclear. Evolution is often thought to be random and dependent on unpredictable events(2). In this light, one might expect the steps taken by adaptation to be completely random, both biologically and temporally. Here I present a mathematical derivation to show that, on the contrary, adaptive steps can have fairly strong rhythm. I find that the strength of the adaptive rhythm, that is its relative temporal regularity, is equal to a constant that is the same for all microbial populations. As a consequence, numbers of accumulated adaptations are predicted to have a universal variance/mean ratio. The theory derived here is potentially applicable to the study of molecular evolution.},

In some cases, such as HIV-1, the early goal of eradicating infections with antimicrobial drugs is, for now, being replaced with the more pragmatic goal of controlling infections over long periods of time through a succession of transiently effective treatments. Because treatment efficacy is often incomplete, studying the degree of treatment efficacy has great relevance to clinical disease management. We derived a model describing the association between the mutation rate of the pathogen and the degree of treatment efficacy. We found that drug treatment is most effective when the mutation rate of the pathogen is either very low or, perhaps counterintuitively, very high. We discuss this finding in the light of a promising new treatment strategy for RNA viruses that combines antiviral compounds with a mutagen.},

   Abstract = {In sexual populations, beneficial mutations that occur in different lineages may be recombined into a single lineage. In asexual populations, however, clones that carry such alternative beneficial mutations compete with one another and, thereby, interfere with the expected progression of a given mutation to fixation. From theoretical exploration of such 'clonal interference', we have derived (1) a fixation probability for beneficial mutations, (2) an expected substitution rate, (3) an expected coefficient of selection for realized substitutions, (4) an expected rate of fitness increase, (5) the probability that a beneficial mutation transiently achieves polymorphic frequency (greater than or equal to 1%), and (6) the probability that a beneficial mutation transiently achieves majority status. Based on (2) and (3), we were able to estimate the beneficial mutation rate and the distribution of mutational effects from changes in mean fitness in an evolving E. coli population.},

Children under 16 were more susceptible to infection in the household (adjusted OR 5.80, 95% CI 2.99-11.82). Treatment with oseltamivir plus widespread use of prophylaxis significantly reduced transmission (estimated reduction 16%).

The "globular domain" of the 1918 hemagglutinin protein was encoded by a part of a gene derived from a swine-lineage influenza, whereas the "stalk" was encoded by parts derived from a human-lineage influenza. Phylogenetic analyses showed that this recombination, which probably changed the virulence of the virus, occurred at the start of, or immediately before, the pandemic and thus may have triggered it.},

After reviewing the supporting theory of stochastic chemical kinetics, I discuss some recent advances in methods for using that theory to make numerical simulations. These include improvements to the exact stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) and the approximate explicit tau-leaping procedure, as well as the development of two approximate strategies for simulating systems that are dynamically stiff: implicit tau-leaping and the slow-scale SSA.},

   Abstract = {Seasonal influenza epidemics are a major public health concern, 
causing tens of millions of respiratory illnesses and 250,000 to 
500,000 deaths worldwide each year1. In addition to seasonal influ- 
enza, a new strain of influenza virus against which no previous 
immunity exists and that demonstrates human-to-human trans- 
mission could result in a pandemic with millions of fatalities2. 
Early detection of disease activity, when followed by a rapid 
response, can reduce the impact of both seasonal and pandemic 
influenza3,4. One way to improve early detection is to monitor 
health-seeking behaviour in the form of queries to online search 
engines, which are submitted by millions of users around the 
world each day. Here we present a method of analysing large 
numbers of Google search queries to track influenza-like illness 
in a population. Because the relative frequency of certain queries is 
highly correlated with the percentage of physician visits in which a 
patient presents with influenza-like symptoms, we can accurately 
estimate the current level of weekly influenza activity in each 
region of the United States, with a reporting lag of about one 
day. This approach may make it possible to use search queries to 
detect influenza epidemics in areas with a large population of web 
search users. },

   Abstract = {The interrelationships of major clades within the Arthropoda remain one of the most contentious issues in systematics, which has traditionally been the domain of morphologists(1,2). A growing body of DNA sequences and other types of molecular data has revitalized study of arthropod phylogeny(3-7) and has inspired new considerations of character evolution(8,9). Novel hypotheses such as a crustacean-hexapod affinity(4,10-12) were based on analyses of single or few genes and limited taxon sampling, but have received recent support from mitochondrial gene order(13), and eye and brain ultrastructure and neurogenesis(14,15). Here we assess relationships within Arthropoda based on a synthesis of all well sampled molecular loci together with a comprehensive data set of morphological, developmental, ultrastructural and gene-order characters. The molecular data include sequences of three nuclear ribosomal genes, three nuclear protein-coding genes, and two mitochondrial genes (one protein coding, one ribosomal). We devised new optimization procedures(16,17) and constructed a parallel computer cluster with 256 central processing units(18) to analyse molecular data on a scale not previously possible. The optimal 'total evidence' cladogram supports the crustacean- hexapod clade, recognizes pycnogonids as sister to other euarthropods, and indicates monophyly of Myriapoda and Mandibulata.},

Hours of emergency medical services (EMS) diversion (when emergency departments could not receive incoming patients) peaked during the influenza seasons studied; the number of EMS diversion hours per season also increased during the seasons 1993–94 to 1997–98, suggesting a decrease in medical care capacity during influenza seasons. Over the seven influenza seasons studied, the number of licensed beds decreased 12%, while the LAC population increased 5%.

   Abstract = {Since influenza A/H1N1 viruses reappeared during the 1977-1978 season, this subtype has contributed 27% of 6,609 documented influenza infections of persons with acute respiratory disease presenting to clinics serving as surveillance sites of the Influenza Research Center in Houston for the 12-year period ending June 1989. Wide differences in the distribution of H1N1 viruses occurred by age group: more than 50% of H1N1 infections were detected among persons aged 10-34 years, compared with 28% for influenza A/H3N2 and 35% for influenza B. Over age 35 years, the contribution of H1N1 viruses dropped to only 4%, compared with 20% and 16% for influenza A/H3N2 and influenza B, respectively. When birth dates of persons with positive cultures were examined, it was found that most of the H1N1-positive persons were born after 1950. Concurrently, longitudinal studies of families and other adults under intensive surveillance for infection, including cultures of all respiratory illnesses and tests for serum antibody rise over the respiratory disease season, revealed appreciable infection rates for adults born before 1950. Furthermore, the annual peak of hospitalization of older persons with pneumonia and other acute respiratory illnesses was significantly correlated with the peak of H1N1 virus activity in 1978-1979, a year when H1N1 viruses were the only influenza viruses prevalent. These observations indicate that many persons infected with influenza A/H1N1 viruses that circulated from 1946 through 1953 have immunity which has persisted for more than 25 years but this immunity is not complete. Reinfection that may result in serious illness in older vulnerable adults does occur but with lower frequency than with influenza A/H3N2 infection. Currently prevalent H1N1 variants are antigenically different from those that circulated in the 1950s; however, older adults readily acquire immunity to these new variants-perhaps as a result of immunologic priming that occurred in childhood.},

   Abstract = {Differentials in health and longevity by socioeconomic status and by the nature of social relationships have been found in innumerable studies in the social and medical sciences. Three categories of explanations for the observed patterns have been proposed: causal mechanisms through which the social environment affects health status or the risk of dying; selection or reverse causal pathways whereby a person's health status affects their social position; and artifactual mechanisms, such as measurement error. The general consensus among researchers is that the observed disparities in health are driven largely by a complex set of causal processes rather than by selection or by artifactual mechanisms. This paper explores the set of arguments and strategies that researchers have used to arrive at this conclusion. As part of this undertaking, we assess whether inferences regarding the minor contribution of selection to the overall association between social factors and health are justifiable. In addition, we identify current avenues of research that are providing new insights into the causal pathways linking social factors and health.},

   Abstract = {In general when a phylogeny is reconstructed from DNA or protein sequence data, it makes use only of the probabilities of obtaining some phylogeny given a collection of data. It is also possible to determine the prior probabilities of different phylogenies. This information can be of use in analyzing the biological causes for the observed divergence of sampled taxa. Unusually "rare" topologies for a given data set may be indicative of different biological forces acting. A recursive algorithm is presented that calculates the prior probabilities of a phylogeny for different allelic samples and for different phylogenies. This method is a straightforward extension of Ewens' sample distribution. The probability of obtaining each possible sample according to Ewens' distribution is further subdivided into each of the possible phylogenetic topologies. These probabilities depend not only on the identity of the alleles and on 4N(mu) (four times the effective population size times the neutral mutation rate) but also on the phylogenetic relationships among the alleles. Illustrations of the algorithm are given to demonstrate how different phylogenies are favored under different conditions.},

   Journal = {Mathematical Biosciences},
   Pages = {30},
   Abstract = {Many of the studies on emerging epidemics (such as SARS and pandemic flu) use mass
action models to estimate reproductive numbers and the needed control measures. In reality,
transmission patterns are more complex due to the presence of various social networks.
One level of complexity can be accommodated by considering a community of households.
Our study of transmission dynamics in a community of households emphasizes five types of
reproductive numbers for the epidemic spread: household-to-household reproductive number,
leaky vaccine-associated reproductive numbers, perfect vaccine reproductive number, growth
rate reproductive number, and the individual reproductive number. Each of those carries
different information about the transmission dynamics, and often some of those can be
estimated from the data while others cannot.
Simulations have shown that under certain scenarios there is an ordering for those
reproductive numbers. We have proven a number of ordering inequalities under general
assumptions about the individual infectiousness profiles. Those inequalities allow, for
instance, to estimate the needed random vaccine coverage and other control measures without
knowing the various transmission parameters in the models.

   Abstract = {We calculate the linear response of a differentially rotating two-dimensional gas disk to a rigidly rotating external [non-axisymmetric] potential.  The main assumptions are that the sound speed is much smaller than the orbital velocity and that the external potential varies on the scale of the disk radius.  We investigate disks both with and without self-gravity.
The external potential exerts torques on the disk only at the LIndblad and corotation resonances.  The torque is positive at the outer Lindbald resonance and negative at the inner Lindblad resonance; at corotation the torque has the sign of the radial gradient of vorticity per unit surface density.  The torques are of the same order of magnitude at both types of resonance and are independent of the sound speed in the disk.
The external potential also excites density waves in the vicinity of the Lindblad and corotation resonances.  The long trailing wave is excited at a Lindblad resonance.  It transports away from the resonance all of the angular momentum which is deposited there by the external torque.  Short trailing waves are excited at the corotation resonance.  The amplitudes of the excited waves are the same on both sides of the resonance and are small unless the disk is almost gravitationally unstable.  No net angular momentum is transported away from the corotation region by the waves.  Thus the angular momentum deposited there by the external torque acumulates in the gas.
We briefly discuss the behavior of particle disks and prove that the external torques on particle disks are identical to those on gas disks.},

   Abstract = {We calculate the rate at which angular momentum and energy are transferred between a disk and a satellite which orbit the same central mass.  A satellite which moves on a circular orbit exerts a torque on the disk only in the immediate vicinity of its Lindblad resonances.  The direction of angular momentum transport is outward, from disk material inside the satellite's orbit to the satellite and from the satellite to disk material outside its orbit.  A satellite with an eccentric orbit exerts a torque on the disk at corotation resonances as well as at Lindblad resonances.  The angular momentum and energy transfer at Lindblad resonances tends to increase the satellite's orbit eccentricity whereas the transfer at corotation resonances tends to decrease it.  In a Keplerian disk, to lowest order in eccentricity and in the absence of nonlinear effects, the corotation resonances dominate by a slight margin and the eccentricity damps.  However, if the strongest corotation resonances saturate due to particle trapping, then the eccentricity grows.
We present an illustrative application of our results to the interaction between Jupiter and the protoplanetary disk.  The angular momentum transfer is shown to be so rapid that substantial changes in both the structure of the disk and the orbit of Jupiter must have taken place on a time scale of a few thousand years.},

The perturbations near a resonance in an eccentic ring may be divided into corotation and Lindblad terms.  For small $e$, the corotation terms damp $e$, whereas the Lindblad terms excite $e$.  In the absence of saturation the corotation terms win by a small margin, and $e$ damps.  However, if the perturbations open gaps at the strongest resonances, then the Lindblad terms win, and $e$ grows.  This result offers an explanation for the existence of both circular and eccentric rings around Uranus.

The examples include a three-cell system exhibiting equilibria, periodic, and quasiperiodic states in different cells; periodic 2n x 2n arrays of cells that generate 2(n) different patterns of synchrony from one symmetry-generated solution; and systems exhibiting multirhythms (periodic solutions with rationally related periods in different cells).

   Abstract = {A coupled cell system is a network of dynamical systems, or "cells," coupled together. The architecture of a coupled cell network is a graph that indicates how cells are coupled and which cells are equivalent. Stewart, Golubitsky, and Pivato presented a framework for coupled cell systems that permits a classification of robust synchrony in terms of network architecture. They also studied the existence of other robust dynamical patterns using a concept of quotient network. There are two difficulties with their approach. First, there are examples of networks with robust patterns of synchrony that are not included in their class of networks; and second, vector fields on the quotient do not in general lift to vector fields on the original network, thus complicating genericity arguments. We enlarge the class of coupled systems under consideration by allowing two cells to be coupled in more than one way, and we show that this approach resolves both difficulties. The theory that we develop, the " multiarrow formalism," parallels that of Stewart, Golubitsky, and Pivato. In addition, we prove that the pattern of synchrony generated by a hyperbolic equilibrium is rigid ( the pattern does not change under small admissible perturbations) if and only if the pattern corresponds to a balanced equivalence relation. Finally, we use quotient networks to discuss Hopf bifurcation in homogeneous cell systems with two-color balanced equivalence relations.},

   Volume = {43},
   Number = {3},
   Pages = {305-365},
   Abstract = {A formal theory of symmetries of networks of coupled dynamical systems, stated in terms of the group of permutations of the nodes that preserve the network topology, has existed for some time. Global network symmetries impose strong constraints on the corresponding dynamical systems, which affect equilibria, periodic states, heteroclinic cycles, and even chaotic states. In particular, the symmetries of the network can lead to synchrony, phase relations, resonances, and synchronous or cycling chaos.
Symmetry is a rather restrictive assumption, and a general theory of networks should be more flexible. A recent generalization of the group-theoretic notion of symmetry replaces global symmetries by bijections between certain subsets of the directed edges of the network, the `input sets'. Now the symmetry group becomes a groupoid, which is an algebraic structure that resembles a group, except that the product of two elements may not be defined. The groupoid formalism makes it possible to extend group-theoretic methods to more general networks, and in particular it leads to a complete classification of `robust' patterns of synchrony in terms of the combinatorial structure of the network.
Many phenomena that would be nongeneric in an arbitrary dynamical system can become generic when constrained by a particular network topology. A network of dynamical systems is not just a dynamical system with a high-dimensional phase space. It is also equipped with a canonical set of observables--the states of the individual nodes of the network. Moreover, the form of the underlying ODE is constrained by the network topology--which variables occur in which component equations, and how those equations relate to each other. The result is a rich and new range of phenomena, only a few of which are yet properly understood.},

   Title = {On the Exponential Instability of N-Body Systems},
   Journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
   Volume = {Preprint (11 May 1992)},
   Abstract = {We reconsider the old problem of the growth of numerical errors in $N$-body integrations.  We analyse the effects of successive encounters and show that these tend to magnify errors on a time scale which is comparable with the crossing time.  This conclusion is based on an approximate treatment of encounters which can be analysed in three ways: by construction of a master equation, by approximate analytic methods, and by simulation.  However, a deeper discussion of the manner in which errors propagate from one star to another implies that the true rate of growth varies inversely as $\ln\ln N$.

Next we study the growth of errors in $N$-body simulations, in which all gravitational interactions are correctly included.  We confirm our earlier results (Heggie \etal~1988) and recent work of Kandrup \& Smith (1991) that the rate of growth of errors per crossing time increases as $N$ increases up to about 30, but that for larger systems the rate of growth is approximately independent of $N$.  In this limit, errors grow with an $e$-folding time which is nearly one-tenth of a crossing time.  This demonstates that the $N$ dependence observed in the pioneering investigation by Miller (1964), who considered systems with $N\le32$, cannot be extended to larger $N$.  We also investigate the rate of growth of errors in $N$-body systems with softenend potentials.  For example, when the softening radius is held at a fixed fraction of the size of the system, the rate of growth of errors varies approximately as $N^{-1/3}$ when $N$ is large enough.

In the final section of the paper we summarise arguments to show that two-body interactions, and not collective effects, are the underlying physical mechanism causing the growth of errors.  We explain the distinction between this instability and two-body relaxation, and discuss its implications for $N$-body simulations.  For example, it can be shown that the accurate simulation of a system up to the time of core collapse would require computations with $O(N)$ decimal places.   After core collapse the rate of growth of errors is still faster, because of three-body interactions involving binaries.},

We show that the distribution of the final epidemic size depends only on the contact rates and the integrated infectiousness. As a particular case, zero infectiousness on an initial time interval corresponds to a period of latency, which does not affect the final epidemic size in general stochastic and deterministic epidemic models, as is well known from the literature.},

The ethical values that inform the recommendations include the precautionary principle, the least restrictive/intrusive alternative, justice, and transparency.

Seizures were divided into those of mesial temporal onset, in which amygdala and hippocampus were involved but the neocortex was not (77 seizures from 17 patients), and those of regional onset in which mesial structures and neocortex were involved (89 seizures from 16 patients). We measured coherence and phase between one amygdala channel and one or two hippocampal channels during the first 10 s to determine which structure was leading the discharge. The following results are from 33 focal- mesial seizures and 30 regional seizures in which amygdala- hippocampus coherence was sufficiently high to measure time delays: the amygdala was leading in 21.2% of focal-mesial and 53.3% of regional seizures, and the hippocampus was leading in 48.5% of focal-mesial and 26.7% of regional seizures (chi- square, P < 0.02); in the remaining seizures, discharges were synchronous in the two structures. We conclude that the amygdala is more likely to lead when seizures are of regional onset, whereas the hippocampus is more likely to lead in focal- mesial seizures. This is probably due to the many connections of the amygdala with surrounding temporal neocortex.},

   Abstract = {A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to study the effects of over-the-counter analgesic/antipyretic medications on virus shedding, immune response, and clinical status in the common cold. Sixty healthy volunteers were challenged intranasally with rhinovirus type 2 and randomized to one of four treatment arms: aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or placebo. Fifty-six volunteers were successfully infected and shed virus on at least 4 days after challenge. Virus shedding, antibody levels, clinical symptoms and signs, and blood leukocyte levels were carefully monitored. Use of aspirin and acetaminophen was associated with suppression of serum neutralizing antibody response (P < .05 vs. placebo) and increased nasal symptoms and signs (P < .05 vs. placebo). A concomitant rise in circulating monocytes suggested that the suppression of antibody response may be mediated through drug effects on monocytes and/or mononuclear phagocytes, There were no significant differences in viral shedding among the four groups, but a trend toward longer duration of virus shedding was observed in the aspirin and acetaminophen groups. },

Preliminary results suggest that if the 1968 - 1969 pandemic strain returned, it would spread concurrently to cities in both the northern and southern hemispheres thereby exhibiting less of the characteristic seasonal swing. In addition, after recognition of pandemic onset in the focal city, the time lag for public health intervention is very short.

   Journal = {The Lancet},
   Volume = {373},
   Number = {9657},
   Pages = {48-57},
   Abstract = {Background
Roughly 3 million people worldwide were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) at the end of 2007, but an estimated 6·7 million were still in need of treatment and a further 2·7 million became infected with HIV in 2007. Prevention efforts might reduce HIV incidence but are unlikely to eliminate this disease. We investigated a theoretical strategy of universal voluntary HIV testing and immediate treatment with ART, and examined the conditions under which the HIV epidemic could be driven towards elimination.
Methods
We used mathematical models to explore the effect on the case reproduction number (stochastic model) and long-term dynamics of the HIV epidemic (deterministic transmission model) of testing all people in our test-case community (aged 15 years and older) for HIV every year and starting people on ART immediately after they are diagnosed HIV positive. We used data from South Africa as the test case for a generalised epidemic, and assumed that all HIV transmission was heterosexual.
Findings
The studied strategy could greatly accelerate the transition from the present endemic phase, in which most adults living with HIV are not receiving ART, to an elimination phase, in which most are on ART, within 5 years. It could reduce HIV incidence and mortality to less than one case per 1000 people per year by 2016, or within 10 years of full implementation of the strategy, and reduce the prevalence of HIV to less than 1% within 50 years. We estimate that in 2032, the yearly cost of the present strategy and the theoretical strategy would both be US$1·7 billion; however, after this time, the cost of the present strategy would continue to increase whereas that of the theoretical strategy would decrease.
Interpretation
Universal voluntary HIV testing and immediate ART, combined with present prevention approaches, could have a major effect on severe generalised HIV/AIDS epidemics. This approach merits further mathematical modelling, research, and broad consultation.},

   Abstract = {A central question in population ecology is the role of 'exogenous' environmental factors versus density-dependent 'endogenous' biological factors in driving changes in population numbers. This question is also central to infectious disease epidemiology, where changes in disease incidence due to behavioural or environmental change must be distinguished from the nonlinear dynamics of the parasite population. Repeated epidemics of primary and secondary syphilis infection in the United States over the past 50 yr have previously been attributed to social and behavioural changes. Here, we show that these epidemics represent a rare example of unforced, endogenous oscillations in disease incidence, with an 8-11-yr period that is predicted by the natural dynamics of syphilis infection, to which there is partially protective immunity. This conclusion is supported by the absence of oscillations in gonorrhoea cases, where a protective immune response is absent. We further demonstrate increased synchrony of syphilis oscillations across cities over time, providing empirical evidence for an increasingly connected sexual network in the United States.},

   Pages = {2541-2550},
   Abstract = {Seasonal change in the incidence of infectious diseases is a common phenomenon in both temperate and 
tropical climates. However, the mechanisms responsible for seasonal disease incidence, and the 
epidemiological consequences of seasonality, are poorly understood with rare exception. Standard 
epidemiological theory and concepts such as the basic reproductive number R0 no longer apply, and the 
implications for interventions that themselves may be periodic, such as pulse vaccination, have not been 
formally examined. This paper examines the causes and consequences of seasonality, and in so doing 
derives several new results concerning vaccination strategy and the interpretation of disease outbreak data. 
It begins with a brief review of published scientiﬁc studies in support of different causes of seasonality in 
infectious diseases of humans, identifying four principal mechanisms and their association with different 
routes of transmission. It then describes the consequences of seasonality for R0, disease outbreaks, 
endemic dynamics and persistence. Finally, a mathematical analysis of routine and pulse vaccination 
programmes for seasonal infections is presented. The synthesis of seasonal infectious disease epidemiology 
attempted by this paper highlights the need for fur ther empirical and theoretical work. },

As early as 1603, the printing press was enlisted to educate the public about urgent health issues. This education took several forms. The City of London, with the tacit permission of the Crown, printed bills of mortality that reported who was dying of what in London, detailed by parish, for the years in the seventeenth century when plague deaths were reported. New books about plague prevention and cures were published; older works were reprinted. The resulting wealth of data gave impetus to the evolution of the new field of epidemiological demographics, founded by John Graunt and Sir William Petty. Publishing in the plague years also established a model for informing the general populace that is not without parallel in today's "information society."},

This multiplicity, typically created by a hierarchy of subcritical subharmonics, can lead to high amplification of the forcing signal and complex switching under chaos and stochastic externalities. Our objective is to understand the structure of these possible modes of system oscillation, in particular the conditions under which they appear and disappear. The analysis is carried out by transforming the problem into a problem of locating the resonances of the system under variable period forcing. The hierarchy of resonances identified has a well defined generic structure based on the natural period of oscillation of the model, whether stable or unstable when isolated. The usefulness and simplicity of this approach is illustrated in a discussion of a range of human diseases. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Four childhood infectious diseases are studied (measles, chickenpox, mumps, and rubella). The computer simulation results show that non-trivial periodic solutions are possible depending on the type of the seasonally varying contact transmission rate. Different periodic solutions with different periods are obtained for different transmission forms. The range of endemic periodic solutions obtained also vary from one disease transmission functional form to another. Apart from measles with a sinusoidal varying contact rate these results are completely original.

We use wavelet phase analysis, which allows for dynamical nonstationarity-a complication in interpreting spatio-temporal patterns in these and many other ecological time series. In the prevaccination era, conspicuous hierarchical waves of infection moved regionally from large cities to small towns; the introduction of measles vaccination restricted but did not eliminate this hierarchical contagion. A mechanistic stochastic model suggests a dynamical explanation for the waves-spread via infective 'sparks' from large 'core' cities to smaller 'satellite' towns. Thus, the spatial hierarchy of host population structure is a prerequisite for these infection waves.},

   Abstract = {A major debate in ecology concerns the relative importance of intrinsic factors and extrinsic environmental variations in determining population size fluctuations1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Spatial correlation of fluctuations in different populations caused by synchronous environmental shocks2,7,8 is a powerful tool for quantifying the impact of environmental variations on population dynamics8,9. However, interpretation of synchrony is often complicated by migration between populations8,10. Here we address this issue by using time series from sheep populations on two islands in the St Kilda archipelago11, 12, 13. Fluctuations in the sizes of the two populations are remarkably synchronized over a 40-year period. A nonlinear time-series model shows that a high and frequent degree of environmental correlation is required to achieve this level of synchrony. The model indicates that if there were less environmental correlation, population dynamics would be much less synchronous than is observed. This is because of a threshold effect that is dependent on population size; the threshold magnifies random differences between populations. A refined model showsthat part of the required environmental synchronicity can be accounted for by large-scale weather variations. These results underline the importance of understanding the interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic influences on population dynamics14.},

   Abstract = {In this paper we discuss limits to the amounts of dark matter which might be present in globular star clusters. For well observed clusters we conclude that the total mass of dark matter is less than about 1.5 times the mass of luminous matter, i.e. < 60% of the entire cluster mass. In central regions and in some clusters the limits are even smaller; for example, in 47 Tuc at most 'V 25% of the total mass can be dark. Although dark matter can dominate the halo, the true tidal radius cannot exceed that of the 'observed' tidal radius, i. e. the one inferred through the standard fitting to a non-dark matter King model. Instead, and somewhat counter-intuitively, the 'observed' tidal limit turns out to be an overestimate of the true tidal limit, if globular clusters have dark haloes.},

   Abstract = {Explaining altruistic cooperation is one of the greatest challenges for evolutionary biology(1-3). One solution to this problem is if costly cooperative behaviours are directed towards relatives(4,5). This idea of kin selection has been hugely influential and applied widely from microorganisms to vertebrates(2-10). However, a problem arises if there is local competition for resources, because this leads to competition between relatives, reducing selection for cooperation(3,11-14). Here we use an experimental evolution approach to test the effect of the scale of competition, and how it interacts with relatedness. The cooperative trait that we examine is the production of siderophores, iron-scavenging agents, in the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa(15-17). As expected, our results show that higher levels of cooperative siderophore production evolve in the higher relatedness treatments. However, our results also show that more local competition selects for lower levels of siderophore production and that there is a significant interaction between relatedness and the scale of competition, with relatedness having less effect when the scale of competition is more local. More generally, the scale of competition is likely to be of particular importance for the evolution of cooperation in microorganisms, and also the virulence of pathogenic microorganisms, because cooperative traits such as siderophore production have an important role in determining virulence(6,9,17-19).},

   Abstract = {Diseases such as plague, typhus, malaria, yellow fever, and dengue fever, transmitted between humans by blood-feeding arthropods, were once common in the United States. Many of these diseases are no longer present, mainly because of changes in land use, agricultural methods, residential patterns, human behavior, and vector control. However, diseases that may be transmitted to humans from wild birds or mammals (zoonoses) continue to circulate in nature in many parts of the country. Most vector-borne diseases exhibit a distinct seasonal pattern, which clearly suggests that they are weather sensitive. Rainfall, temperature, and other weather variables affect in many ways both the vectors and the pathogens they transmit. For example, high temperatures can increase or reduce survival rate, depending on the vector, its behavior, ecology, and many other factors. Thus, the probability of transmission may or may not be increased by higher temperatures. The tremendous growth in international travel increases the risk of importation of vector-borne diseases, some of which can be transmitted locally under suitable circumstances at the right time of the year. But demographic and sociologic factors also play a critical role in determining disease incidence, and it is unlikely that these diseases will cause major epidemics in the United States if the public health infrastructure is maintained and improved.},

   Abstract = {There is still uncertainty on the correlates of protection by influenza vaccine. To determine the relationship between hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) titer and the specificity and avidity of serum antibodies, we analyzed serum from a longitudinal trial (1983-1987) of influenza vaccine efficacy [Keitel WA, Cate TR, Couch RB, Huggins LL, Hess KR. Efficacy of repeated annual immunization with inactivated influenza virus vaccines over a five year period. Vaccine 1997; 15(10):1114-22]. We captured native virus particles with fetuin and separately measured relative antibody levels and avidities of antibodies against native glycoproteins and antibodies against denatured viral proteins. Most subjects had pre-existing antibodies against A/Victoria/75 and, although 70\% had >two-fold increased antibodies against A/Philippines/82 after vaccination, only 30\% showed increased antibodies to A/Victoria/75 indicating no dominance of original antigenic sin. There was variation in the levels of antibodies to unfolded antigens compared to native, but antibodies against denatured proteins never exceeded those against native virus. In some cases, the avidity increased without a significant increase in antibody concentration, which might explain why some vaccinees with low HI titer demonstrate adequate protection. We found that the negative correlation between pre-vaccination HI titer and the increase after vaccination is also seen when antibodies are measured directly, but that there is little relationship between HI titer and antibodies against native glycoproteins, either in amount or avidity. Our assay, which has also been adapted for recent influenza viruses that do not bind to fetuin, may be useful for vaccine evaluation.},

   Abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a new, highly contagious, viral disease, emerged in China late in2002 and quickly spread to 32 countries and regions causing in excess of 774 deaths and 8098 infectionsworldwide. In the absence of a rapid diagnostic test, therapy or vaccine, isolation of individuals diagnosedwith SARS and quarantine of individuals feared exposed to SARS virus were used to control the spread ofinfection. We examine mathematically the impact of isolation and quarantine on the control of SARS duringthe outbreaks in Toronto, Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing using a deterministic model that closelymimics the data for cumulative infected cases and SARS-related deaths in the first three regions but not inBeijing until mid-April, when China started to report data more accurately. The results reveal that achievinga reduction in the contact rate between susceptible and diseased individuals by isolating the latter is a criti-cally important strategy that can!   control SARS outbreaks with or without quarantine. An optimal isolationprogramme entails timely implementation under stringent hygienic precautions defined by a critical thresh-old value. Values below this threshold lead to control, but those above are associated with the incidence ofnew community outbreaks or nosocomial infections, a known cause for the spread of SARS in each region.Allocation of resources to implement optimal isolation is more effective than to implement sub-optimal iso-lation and quarantine together. A community-wide eradication of SARS is feasible if optimal isolation iscombined with a highly effective screening programme at the points of entry},

If R-0 > 1, P-0 is unstable, and a unique endemic equilibrium P-* is globally asymptotically stable, and the disease persists at the endemic equilibrium. The basic reproduction numbers for the SP model with density dependent incidence forms are also discussed.},

In this paper we demonstrate that simple models of strain heterogeneity can generate periodic behaviour as a consequence of the interaction between parasite strains and host immunological defences. As the degree of cross- immunity between strains increases, the system moves from a regime of independent strain transmission and coexistence, through increasingly coupled behaviour, to the displacement of the strain of lower transmissibility by the strain with a higher basic reproductive rate (R(0)). Cross-immunity thus serves both to bring the strains into competition, and also to couple the dynamics. We find analytical and numerical results on strain coexistence to show how the range of possible outcomes may be read as an effect of the tension between these two effects of cross-protection.},

   Abstract = {Asymmetries in the costs and benefits of parental investment for mothers, fathers and offspring result in family conflict over the production and provisioning of young(1-3). In species where females provide most resources before and after birth, the resolution of this conflict may be influenced by genes expressed in mothers and by maternally and paternally inherited genes expressed in offspring(4,5). Here we disentangle these effects by means of reciprocal mating and cross-fostering of litters between two strains of mice that differ with respect to the typical resolution of family conflict. We find that differences in litter size between these two strains are determined by paternal genotype, whereas differences in provisioning are under maternal control, showing that there is antagonistic coadaptation of maternal and paternal effects on distinct life-history traits. Maternal provisioning is also influenced by the type of foster offspring. Contradictory to theoretical expectations, however, we find no evidence for a negative correlation across strains between maternal provisioning and offspring demand. Instead, we show that there is positive coadaptation such that offspring obtain more resources from foster mothers of the same strain as their natural mother, irrespective of their father's strain.},

   Abstract = {The need for a planned response to a deliberate introduction of smallpox has recently become urgent. We constructed a stochastic simulator of the spread of smallpox in structured communities to compare the effectiveness of mass vaccination versus targeted vaccination of close contacts of cases. Mass vaccination before smallpox introduction or immediately after the first cases was more effective than targeted vaccination in preventing and containing epidemics if there was no prior herd immunity (that is, no prior immunologic protection within the population). The effectiveness of postrelease targeted and mass vaccinations increased if we assumed that there was residual immunity in adults vaccinated before 1972, but the effectiveness of targeted vaccination increased more than that of mass vaccination. Under all scenarios, targeted vaccination prevented more cases per dose of vaccine than did mass vaccination. Although further research with larger-scale structured models is needed, our results suggest that increasing herd immunity, perhaps with a combination of preemptive voluntary vaccination and vaccination of first responders, could enhance the effectiveness of postattack intervention. It could also help targeted vaccination be more competitive with mass vaccination at both preventing and containing a deliberate introduction of smallpox.},

A key distinction is between analysis of policy and analysis for policy, which has eight key features: problem-centered; bias to facts and data; multidisciplinary; emphasis on feasibility; uses techniques and political awareness; quantitative and qualitative analysis; role of values; and timing of analysis. Decision-making is not a rational, logical process in which information and research determine policy outcomes, but a highly political process in which power and interest are the main driving forces. Health policy analyses can make a small contribution. Communication and salesmanship must go hand in hand with good academic techniques if research is to influence policy.},

   Title = {Consciousness, the brain, and spacetime geometry},
   Journal = {Cajal and Consciousness},
   Volume = {929},
   Pages = {74-104},
   Abstract = {What is consciousness? Conventional approaches see it as an emergent property of complex interactions among individual neurons; however these approaches fail to address enigmatic features of consciousness. Accordingly, some philosophers have contended that "qualia," or an experiential medium from which consciousness is derived, exists as a fundamental component of reality. Whitehead, for example, described the universe as being composed of "occasions of experience." To examine this possibility scientifically, the very nature of physical reality must be re-examined. We must come to terms with the physics of spacetime as described by Einstein's general theory of relativity, and its relation to the fundamental theory of matter-as described by quantum theory. Roger Penrose has proposed a new physics of objective reduction: "OR," which appeals to a form of quantum gravity to provide a useful description of fundamental processes at the quantum/classical borderline.(1,2) Within the OR scheme, we consider that consciousness occurs if an appropriately organized system is able to develop and maintain quantum coherent superposition until a specific "objective" criterion (a threshold related to quantum gravity) is reached; the coherent system then self- reduces (objective reduction: OR). We contend that this type of objective self-collapse introduces non-computability, an essential feature of consciousness which distinguishes our minds from classical computers. Each OR is taken as an instantaneous event-the climax of a self-organizing process in fundamental spacetime-and a candidate for a conscious Whitehead "occasion of experience." How could an OR process occur in the brain, be coupled to neural activities, and account for other features of consciousness? We nominate a quantum computational OR process with the requisite characteristics to be occurring in cytoskeletal microtubules within the brain's neurons (3-5). In this model, quantum-superposed states develop in microtubule subunit proteins ("tubulins") within certain brain neurons, remain coherent, and recruit more superposed tubulins until a mass-time-energy threshold (related to quantum gravity) is reached. At that point, self-collapse, or objective reduction (OR), abruptly occurs. We equate the pre-reduction, coherent superposition ("quantum computing") phase with pre-conscious processes, and each instantaneous (and non-computable) OR, or self-collapse, with a discrete conscious event. Sequences of OR events give rise to a "stream" of consciousness. Microtubule- associated proteins can "tune" the quantum oscillations of the coherent superposed states; the OR is thus self-organized, or "orchestrated" ("Orch OR"). Each Orch OR event selects (non- computably) microtubule subunit states which regulate synaptic/neural functions using classical signaling. The quantum gravity threshold for self-collapse is relevant to consciousness, according to our arguments, because macroscopic superposed quantum states each have their own spacetime geometries.(1,2) These geometries are also superposed, and in some way "separated," but when sufficiently separated, the superposition of spacetime geometries becomes significantly unstable and reduces to a single universe state. Quantum gravity determines the limits of the instability; we contend that the actual choice of state made by Nature is noncomputable. Thus each Orch OR event is a self-selection of spacetime geometry, coupled to the brain through microtubules and other biomolecules. If conscious experience is intimately connected with the very physics underlying spacetime structure, then Orch OR in microtubules indeed provides us with a completely new and uniquely promising perspective on the difficult problems of consciousness.},

   Abstract = {A genetical mathematical model is described which allows for interactions between relatives on one another's fitness. Making use of Wright's Coefficient of Relationship as the measure of the proportion of replica genes in a relative, a quantity is found which incorporates the maximizing property of Darwinian fitness. This quantity is named “inclusive fitness”. Species following the model should tend to evolve behaviour such that each organism appears to be attempting to maximize its inclusive fitness. This implies a limited restraint on selfish competitive behaviour and possibility of limited self-sacrifices.

Special cases of the model are used to show (a) that selection in the social situations newly covered tends to be slower than classical selection, (b) how in populations of rather non-dispersive organisms the model may apply to genes affecting dispersion, and (c) how it may apply approximately to competition between relatives, for example, within sibships. Some artificialities of the model are discussed. },

More general application of the theory in biology is then discussed, particular attention being given to cases where the indicated interpretation differs from previous views and to cases which appear anomalous. A hypothesis is outlined concerning social evolution in the Hymenoptera; but the evidence that at present exists is found somewhat contrary on certain points. Other subjects considered include warning behaviour, the evolution of distasteful properties in insects, clones of cells and clones of zooids as contrasted with other types of colonies, the confinement of parental care to true offspring in birds and insects, fights, the behaviour of parasitoid insect larvae within a host, parental care in connection with monogyny and monandry and multi-ovulate ovaries in plants in connection with wind and insect pollination. },

According to this hypothesis, individuals within a signalling species show variation in the expression of autumn coloration, with defensively committed trees producing a more intense display. Insects are expected to he averse to the brightest tree individuals and, hence, preferentially colonize the least defensive hosts. We predicted that tree species suffering greater insect damage would, on average, invest more in autumn-colour signalling than less troubled species. Here, we shoe that autumn coloration is stronger in species facing a high diversity of damaging specialist aphids. Aphids are likely to be all important group of signal receivers because they are choosy, damaging and use colour cues in host selection. In the light of further aspects of insect and tree biology, these results support the notion that bright autumn colours are expensive handicap signals revealing the defensive commitment of individual trees to autumn colonizing insect pests.},

   Abstract = {Is development best achieved by going for growth, or does specific attention need to be paid to directly improving human welfare? In contrast to the Human Development Reports of the UNDP, the World Bank has stressed the growth approach. Recent work has reinforced this position by arguing that health spending is extremely ineffective in reducing infant or child mortality, which is mainly explained by a country's income per capita. This article contests this position through testing the robustness of determinants of infant and child mortality. We have estimated over 420,000 equations which show that, while income per capita is a robust determinant of infant and child mortality, so are indicators of health, education and gender inequality. Some health spending, such as immunisation, is thus shown to be cost effective way of saving lives. Our results are consistent with the view that much health spending in developing countries may be poorly targeted or otherwise ineffective, but do not support the position that public health strategies should not be given too great a role in pursuing improvements in human welfare.},

   Abstract = {Many biologically important processes, such as genetic differentiation, the spread of disease, and population stability, are affected by the (natural or enforced) subdivision of populations into networks of smaller, partly isolated, subunits. Such "metapopulations" can have extremely complex dynamics. We present a new general model that uses only two functions to capture, at the meta-population scale, the main behavior of metapopulations. We show how complex, structured metapopulation models can be translated into our generalized framework. The metapopulation dynamics arising from some important biological processes are illustrated: the rescue effect, the Allee effect, and what we term the "antirescue effect." The antirescue effect captures instances where high migration rates are deleterious to population persistence, a phenomenon that has been largely ignored in metapopulation conservation theory. Management regimes that ignore a significant antirescue effect will be inadequate and may actually increase extinction risk. Further, consequences of territoriality and conspecific attraction on metapopulation- level dynamics are investigated. The new, simplified framework can incorporate knowledge from epidemiology, genetics, and population biology in a phenomenological way. It opens up new possibilities to identify and analyze the factors that are important for the evolution and persistence of the many spatially subdivided species.},

Recent studies of the evolution of dispersal in temporally varying environments suggest that clones differing in dispersal rates can coexist indefinitely. In this work, we explore the mechanism permitting such coexistence for a model of dispersal in a patchy environment, where temporal heterogeneity arises from endogenous chaotic dynamics. We show that coexistence arises from an extreme type of intermittent behavior, namely the phenomenon known as on-off intermittency. In effect, coexistence arises because of an alternation between synchronized and de-synchronized dynamical behaviors. Our analysis of the dynamical mechanism for on-off intermittency lends strong credence to the proposition that chaotic synchronism may be a general feature of species coexistence, where competing species differ only in dispersal rate.},

   Abstract = {The top-down and bottom-up properties of model food webs that include intraguild predation and self-limiting factors such as cannibalism are investigated. Intraguild predation can dampen or even reverse the top-down effects predicted by food chain theory. The degree of self-limitation among the intraguild prey is a key factor in determining the direction and strength of the top-down response. Intraguild predation and self-limiting factors can also substantially alter the bottom-up effects of enrichment. These results can help explain the disparate results of trophic cascade experiments in lakes, where cascades are usually seen when large Daphnia are the primary herbivores, but not when smaller-bodied herbivores are dominant. Top-down manipulations should cascade at least modestly to phytoplankton in those lakes whose food web can be reasonably approximated by a chain (typically, those where Daphnia is the dominant herbivore), as predicted by food chain theory. On the other hand, smaller-bodied zooplankton are often preyed upon heavily by invertebrate predators as well as by planktivorous fish, thereby introducing elements of intraguild predation into these food webs. In this case, conventional food chain theory is likely to give incorrect predictions. Very large cascade effects may be due primarily to regime shifts between intraguild predation-dominated food webs and those that more resemble food chains, rather than due to the simple food chain cascade usually considered.

   Abstract = {An age-structured model is developed for analyzing the effects of marine reserves and other long-term closures on fishery yield, assuming larvae are well-mixed and that exchange of adults between the open and closed areas is negligible. A number of analytic results are derived, including a formula for the gradient of yield with respect to fishing mortality and closure fraction. Increasing the closure fraction at equilibrium spawning stock biomass (SSB), B, will increase yield if and only if s'(B) > 1/b(0)(0), where s'(B) is the slope of the stock-recruitment curve at B and b(0)(0) is SSB per recruit at zero fishing mortality. Conditions for the level of closure required to prevent stock collapse are also derived. Applications of the theory to canary rockfish (Sebastes pinniger) and Georges Bank sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) illustrate that long-term closures increase yield only at low SSB associated with fishing mortalities greater than F-MSY and with low closure fractions. The theory presented here gives simple analytic and graphical techniques for predicting the effects of long-term closures on yield and stock persistence.},

   Journal = {PLoS Medicine},
   Volume = {3},
   Number = {1},
   Pages = {e7},
   Abstract = {Cholera is an ancient disease that continues to cause epidemic and pandemic disease despite 
ongoing efforts to limit its spread. Mathematical models provide one means of assessing the 
utility of various proposed interventions. However, cholera models that have been developed 
to date have had limitations, suggesting that there are basic elements of cholera transmission 
that we still do not understand. Recent laboratory findings suggest that passage of Vibrio cholerae O1 Inaba El Tor through the gastrointestinal tract results in a short-lived, hyperinfectious state of the organism that decays in a matter of hours into a state of lower infectiousness. Incorporation of this 
hyperinfectious state into our disease model provides a much better fit with the observed 
epidemic pattern of cholera. These findings help to substantiate the clinical relevance of 
laboratory observations regarding the hyperinfectious state, and underscore the critical 
importance of human-to-human versus environment-to-human transmission in the generation 
of epidemic and pandemic disease. To have maximal impact on limiting epidemic spread of cholera, interventions should be targeted toward minimizing risk of transmission of the short-lived, hyperinfectious form of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae. The possibility of comparable hyperinfectious states in other major epidemic diseases also needs to be evaluated and, as appropriate, incorporated into models of disease prevention.

   Abstract = {Infectious diseases can cause rapid population declines or species extinctions. Many pathogens of terrestrial and marine taxa are sensitive to temperature, rainfall, and humidity, creating synergisms that could affect biodiversity. Climate warming can increase pathogen development and survival rates, disease transmission, and host susceptibility. Although most host-parasite systems are predicted to experience more frequent or severe disease impacts with warming, a subset of pathogens might decline with warming, releasing hosts from disease. Recently, changes in El Nin˜ o –Southern Oscillation events have had a detectable inﬂuence on marine and terrestrial pathogens, including coral diseases, oyster pathogens, crop pathogens, Rift Valley fever, and human cholera. To improve our ability to predict epidemics in wild populations, it will be necessary to separate the independent and interactive effects of multiple climate drivers on disease impact. },

   Abstract = {A study of one of the simplest systems incorporating both dispersal and local dynamics, coupling two discrete time logistic equations, demonstrates several surprising features. Passive dispersal can cause chaotic dynamics to be replaced by simple periodic dynamics. Thus passive movement can be stabilizing, even in a deterministic model without underlying spatial variation in the dynamics. The boundary between initial conditions leading to qualitatively different dynamics can be a fractal, so it is essentially impossible to specify the asymptotic behavior in terms of the initial conditions. In accord with several recent studies of arthropods and earlier theoretical work, density dependence may only be detectable at a small enough spatial scale, so efforts to uncover density dependence must include investigations of movement.},

In this hypothesis-generating study supported by a convenience sample drawn in close temporal proximity to the period of quarantine, we examined the psychological effects of quarantine on persons in Toronto, Canada. The 129 quarantined persons who responded to a Web-based survey exhibited a high prevalence of psychological distress. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression were observed in 28.9\% and 31.2\% of respondents, respectively. Longer durations of quarantine were associated with an increased prevalence of PTSD symptoms. Acquaintance with or direct exposure to someone with a diagnosis of SARS was also associated with PTSD and depressive symptoms.},

   Pages = {289-303},
   Abstract = {The nucleotide sequences of the eight different influenza A virus segments (genes) 
were compared among 14 different subtypes. These comparisons demonstrate 
the presence of molecular clocks in the viral genes; they accumulated both silent 
and amino acid-changing substitutions at approximately constant rates with 
respect to time during evolution. In addition, comparison of the rates of evolution 
among the eight viral genes, excluding the P2 gene, revealed a rapid and roughly 
equal rate of silent substitution for different genes. The P2 gene exception is 
explained as the result of recombination (reassortment) between distantly related 
strains. The rate of amino acid-changing substitution differs greatly from gene 
to gene. The rate of silent substitution was estimated to be 1.1 X lo-*/site/year 
on the average-that is, about 2 X lo6 times higher than eukaryotic gene 
equivalents, which is remarkable. Strain A/USSR/90/77 was shown to evolve 
with a rate that is similar to those of other strains but to behave as if replication 
was frozen during a certain period (Nakajima et al. 1978). The frozen period 
was estimated to be 25 yr on the basis of the molecular clock. A similar analysis 
revealed another example of frozen replication-in this case, apparently for a 
period of about 9 yr-in a duck strain, A/duck/Ontario/77. },

   Pages = {1282-1289},
   Abstract = {Background: As prophylaxis against influenza in families, amantadine and rimantadine have had inconsistent effectiveness, partly because of the transmission of drug-resistant variants from treated index patients. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of inhaled zanamivir for the treatment and prevention of influenza in families. Methods: We enrolled families (with two to five members and at least one child who was five years of age or older) before the 1998-1999 influenza season. If an influenza-like illness developed in one member, the family was randomly assigned to receive either inhaled zanamivir or placebo. The family member with the index illness was treated with either 10 mg of inhaled zanamivir (163 subjects) or placebo (158) twice a day for 5 days, and the other family members received either 10 mg of zanamivir (414 subjects) or placebo (423) once a day as prophylaxis for 10 days. The primary end point was the proportion of families in which at least one household contact had symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed influenza. Results: The proportion of families with at least one initially healthy household contact in whom influenza developed was smaller in the zanamivir group than in the placebo group (4 percent vs. 19 percent, P<0.001); the difference represented a 79 percent reduction in the proportion of families with at least one affected contact. Zanamivir provided protection against both influenza A and influenza B. A neuraminidase-inhibition assay and sequencing of the neuraminidase and hemagglutinin genes revealed no zanamivir-resistant variants. Among the subjects with index cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza, the median duration of symptoms was 2.5 days shorter in the zanamivir group than in the placebo group (5.0 vs. 7.5 days, P=0.01). Zanamivir was well tolerated. Conclusions: When combined with the treatment of index cases, prophylactic treatment of family members with once-daily inhaled zanamivir is well tolerated and prevents the development of influenza. In this study there was no evidence of the emergence of resistant influenza variants. (N Engl J Med 2000;343:1282-9.) (C) 2000, Massachusetts Medical Society.},

The initial conditions of the first group are those of the I.A.U.~``Standard problem''.  Those of the second group are such that the virial coefficient is equal to~1.
In both cases the reproducibility of these numerical experiments is limited to the beginning of the evolution.  For that period very few close encounters occur and the motion of the bodies is governed mainly by the mean field.  The reproducibility is all the better for the individual coordinates of these bodies which move far from the central region of the system.
The instability of the solutions of the $N$-body gravitational problem as well as the integration method and the finite number of bits used by computers---this number is not the same for different computers---are responsible of the defect of reproducibility.},

   Abstract = {Statistical inference for mechanistic models of partially observed dynamic systems is an active 
area of research. Most existing inference methods place substantial restrictions upon the form 
of models that can be ﬁtted and hence upon the nature of the scientiﬁc hypotheses that can be 
entertained and the data that can be used to evaluate them. In contrast, the so-called plug- 
and-play methods require only simulations from a model and are thus free of such restrictions. 
We show the utility of the plug-and-play approach in the context of an investigation of 
measles transmission dynamics. Our novel methodology enables us to ask and answer ques- 
tions that previous analyses have been unable to address. Speciﬁcally, we demonstrate that 
plug-and-play methods permit the development of a modelling and inference framework 
applicable to data from both large and small populations. We thereby obtain novel 
insights into the nature of heterogeneity in mixing and comment on the importance of 
including extra-demographic stochasticity as a means of dealing with environmental sto- 
chasticity and model misspeciﬁcation. Our approach is readily applicable to many other 
epidemiological and ecological systems.},

Today, R-0 is a more fully developed adult in epidemiology than in demography. In the final section I give an algorithm for its calculation in heterogeneous populations.},

   Abstract = {For infectious diseases where immunization can offer lifelong protection, a variety of simple models can be
used to explain the utility of vaccination as a control method. However, for many diseases, immunity wanes
over time and is subsequently enhanced (boosted) by asymptomatic encounters with the infection. The
study of this type of epidemiological process requires a model formulation that can capture both the withinhost
dynamics of the pathogen and immune system as well as the associated population-level transmission
dynamics. Here, we parametrize such a model for measles and show how vaccination can have a range of
unexpected consequences as it reduces the natural boosting of immunity as well as reducing the number
of naive susceptibles. In particular, we show that moderate waning times (40–80 years) and high levels of
vaccination (greater than 70%) can induce large-scale oscillations with substantial numbers of symptomatic
cases being generated at the peak. In addition, we predict that, after a long disease-free period, the
introduction of infection will lead to far larger epidemics than that predicted by standard models. These
results have clear implications for the long-termsuccess of any vaccination campaign and highlight the need
for a sound understanding of the immunological mechanisms of immunity and vaccination.

   Journal = {\ApJ},
   Volume = {Preprint (11 May 1992).},
   Abstract = {Gravitational scattering processes are discussed withing a physical framework similar to that used in laboratory scattering, the main differences being that our projectiles and targets are made up out of stars and that our lab is a computer.  As in other scattering problems, our aim is to synthesize exact results (such as detailed balance), theoretical estimates, asymptotic analyses, and experimental data, in order to establish simple formulae for the relevant cross sections and reactions rates.

The present paper aims at depth, rather than breadth, by presenting a comprehensive treatment of a limited set of processes.  The limitation lies in our choice of experiments: binary-single star scattering in the equal mass point-particle approximation; and our choice of measurements: energy transfer between projectile and target averaged over a thermal eccentricity distribution for the target binary.  This treatment will be useful, not only for the direct astrophysical applications in which our limitations are approximately met, but also as a worked-out example of the treatment of gravitational scattering processes.

Specifically, our formalae describe (i)~differential cross sections for exchange of energy between single star and binary; (ii)~their averages over a Maxwellian distribution of encounter velocities to arrive at thermal rates; and (iii)~the mean and mean square energy exchange, both for a given encounter speed as well as for a Maxwellian velocity distribution.  The results are briefly illustrated in three applications to stellar dynamics.},

Previous work has been very successful in predicting such transitions in New York City's measles incidence rates using the standard SIR model (susceptible, infected, recovered). This work relied on a dataset spanning 45 years, which we have extended to 93 years (1891--1984). We continue previous research in transition analysis on this larger dataset, and compare resonant and transient periods predicted to exist in NYC's measles incidence rates with those observed through a continuous wavelet transform of the data. We find good agreement between SIR predictions and observation, and in particular note the likely existence of previously unobserved hysteresis early in our new time--series.},

   Volume = {55},
   Number = {3},
   Pages = {459-466},
   Abstract = {Empirical tests for the importance of population mixing in constraining adaptive divergence have not been well grounded in theory for quantitative traits in spatially discrete populations. We develop quantitative-genetic models to examine the equilibrium difference between two populations that are experiencing different selective regimes and exchanging individuals. These models demonstrate that adaptive divergence is negatively correlated with the rate of population mixing (m, most strongly so when m is low), positively correlated with the difference in phenotypic optima between populations, and positively correlated with the amount of additive genetic variance (G, most strongly so when G is low). The approach to equilibrium is quite rapid (fewer than 50 generations for two populations to evolve 90\%: of the distance to equilibrium) when either heritability or mixing are not too low (h(2) > 0.2 or m > 0.05). The theory can he used to aid empirical tests that: (1) compare o!  bserved divergence to that predicted using estimates of population mixing, additive genetic variance/covariance, and selection; (2) test for a negative correlation between population mixing and adaptive divergence across multiple independent population pairs: and (3) experirnentally manipulate the rate of mixing. Application of the first two of these approaches to data from two well-studied natural systems suggests that population mixing has constrained adaptive divergence for color patterns in Lake Erie water snakes (Nerodia sipedon. but nor for trophic traits in sympatric pairs of benthic and limnetic stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus. The theoretical framework we outline should provide an improved basis for future empirical tests of the role of population mixing in adaptive divergence.},

   Volume = {157},

   Abstract = {Existing optimality models of propagule size and number are not appropriate for many organisms. First, existing models assume a monotonically increasing offspring fitness/propagule size relationship. However, offspring survival during certain stages may decrease with increasing propagule size, generating a peaked offspring fitness/propagule size function (e.g., egg size in oxygen-limited aquatic environments). Second, existing models typically do not consider maternal effects on total reproductive output and the expression of offspring survival/propagule size relationships. However, larger females often have greater total egg production and may provide better habitats for their offspring. We develop a specific optimality model that incorporates these effects and test its predictions using data from salmonid fishes. We then outline a general model without assuming specific functional forms and test its predictions using data from freshwater fishes. Our theoretical and empi!  rical results illustrate that, when offspring survival is negatively correlated with propagule size, optimal propagule size is larger in better habitats. When larger females provide better habitats, their optimal propagule size is larger. Nevertheless, propagule number should increase more rapidly than propagule size for a given increase in maternal size. In the absence of density dependence, females with greater relative reproductive output (i.e., for a given body size) should produce more but not larger propagules.},

   Pages = {421-429},
   Abstract = {Positive correlations between maternal size and propagule (egg, seed, embryo) size could arise for several reasons. One of these is that larger mothers may improve the survival of their offspring during a stage when large propagules typically have lower survival than small propagules. We previously developed an optimality model that incorporated this effect and used it to explain the positive correlation between female size and egg size in some fishes. Our original analysis included the common assumption that large eggs have lower survival than small eggs when dissolved oxygen is low (because of surface-to-volume constraints). Recent empirical work, however, has suggested just the opposite: large eggs actually have higher survival than small eggs when dissolved oxygen is low. Here we re- analyse our original model in the light of this new evidence, showing that the original explanation for positive egg size- female size correlations no longer holds, but that new candidate!   explanations emerge. Specifically, larger females should produce larger eggs when they provide incubation environments of lower quality (i.e. lower dissolved oxygen). One way this might occur is that larger females produce larger clutches, which should have higher total oxygen demand. The re- analysis demonstrates that our theoretical approach can accommodate a variety of assumptions and may prove useful as a general framework for predicting variation in optimal egg size.},

   Abstract = {In chapter I we give an exposition of D.~Birkhoff's 1920 theory of curves invariant by area preserving monotone twist maps of an annulus $A={\bf T} \times \reals$ (a curve means a $C^0$-embedded circle that we suppose non-homotopic to zero).  In an appendix to chapter~I Albert Fathi gives a more topological proof of Birkhoff's theorem about curves being graphs.  

Using Birkhoff's theory we show that Moser's invariant curve theorem (improved by H.~R\"ussmann) is optimal up to $\varepsilon>0$: in particular we show in chapter~II that usually for $C^{3-\varepsilon}$-perturbations of a $C^\infty$-complete integrable monotone twist map there exists no invariant curve of a fixed rotation number.  We give another proof of this result in chapter~III, by consturcting an area perserving $C^{3-\varepsilon}$-diffeomorphism $f$ of $A$ that leaves invariant a curve $C$ and such that $f|C$ is a Denjoy counter-example.

In chapter~II we also give counter-examples to stability for  $C^{2-\varepsilon}$-perturbations and other results on the optimal character of the known invariant curve theorem.

In chapter~III, at the end, we give some insight of the geometry of the set of ``standard-diffeomorphisms'' of $A$ that leave invariant a curve.

In chapter~IV we prove H.~R\"ussmann's translated curve theorem in class $C^{3+\varepsilon}$, $\varepsilon>0$, if one restricts the rotation number on the translated curve to be a number of constant type.  (The translated curve theorem is a non-conservative generalization of Moser's invariant curve theorem.)  The proof makes use of special properties of number of constant type, standard facts on H\"older functions, and only requires Schauder-Tychonoff's fixed point theorm.  We believe that the method is simpler than the other existing techniques.

A volume~II is planned and will be about more elaborate existence theorems of invariant curves.},

   Pages = {375--397},
   Abstract = {An algorithm for evolving collisionless stellar systems is described.  Our approach is similar to that suggested earlier by van Albada, McGlynn, and more specifically Clutton-Brock, in that Poisson's equation is solved by expanding the density and potential in a set of basis functions.  However, the basis set used here is constructed so that the lowest order members well-approximate a galaxy obeying the de Vaucouleurs $R^{1/4}$ law in projection.  Consequently, it will be possible to study the evolution of systems with density profiles like the $R^{1/4}$ law using only a few terms in the expansions.  A good fit is also obtained for a truncated isothermal distribution and, so, our method wil be quite appropriate for galaxies with flat rotation curves.
Since our method is similar in spirit to solving $N$ one-body problems, the cpu cost scales with paticle number as $O(N)$ with a relatively small coefficient.  Hence, calculations employing $N\sim 10^6$--$10^7$ are straightforward on existing supercomputers, making possible simulations having significantly smoother fields than with direct methods such as tree-codes.  Even larger $N$ should be feasible on multiple-cpu computers since opportunities for parallelism abound.
Moreover, the flexibility of the algorithm suggests a number of refinements that may suppress discreteness noise relative to direct $N$-body methods.  Owing to its one-body character, our method lends itself to an iterative technique akin to those utilized by Ostriker and collaborators for nonspherical stars and by Schwarzschild for equilibrium stellar-dynamical sytems.  In the present context, one finds orbits in a given static or time-dependent gravitational field and then, from the resultant density, $\rho( {\bf r}, t )$, revises the potential, $\varphi( {\bf r}, t )$.  However, because of Poisson noise in the representation of the density field, the convergence properties of this scheme are problematic.
Possible uses of our technique are discussed, including tidal perturbations of dwarf galaxies, the adiabatic growth of central masses in spheroidal galaxies, instabilities in realistic galaxy models, and secular processes in galactic evolution.},

   Journal = {Ecology},
   Volume = {77},
   Number = {5},
   Pages = {1617-1632},
   Abstract = {Several conservation measures are intended to enhance the movement of individuals among populations. These include the establishment of wildlife corridors, captive breeding and release programs, and translocation of individuals among populations. Many metapopulation models show that increasing movement among populations reduces the chance of metapopulation extinction. However, epidemiological models indicate that increased contact among populations enhances the spread of disease and can trigger epidemics. I have synthesized elements of mathematical epidemiology with metapopulation models. An analytic model showed that highly contagious diseases of moderate severity spread widely, increasing the probability of metapopulation extinction. I also used a simulation model to examine four spatial arrangements of populations: island, necklace, loop, and spider. When infected individuals were allowed to move freely among populations, all of the arrangements exhibited qualitative behavior similar to that exhibited by the analytic models. The most dangerous diseases were those for which infected populations grew large enough to produce dispersers that infected other populations, but which also reduced the geometric rate of increase for infected populations to near unity. Under those conditions, random demographic and environmental events caused metapopulation extinction. Major differences among the spatial arrangements emerged when a quarantine population was established. A centralized quarantine in the spider and necklace arrangement yielded the most dramatic reductions in metapopulation extinction probability. A single quarantine patch was of little value in an island arrangement. These results have several implications for managing metapopulations. Most notably, some spatial arrangements of populations are more amenable to disease control than others, and establishing a quarantine population can increase the probability of detecting new diseases and reduce the impact of diseases that do appear.},

age distribution. Computer simulations of the mathematical model are used to study pertussis in the United States. Both before
and after vaccination began in 1940, the reported incidence of pertussis has been cyclical with a period of 3 to 4 years.
Because a seasonal contact rate in models for measles leads to subharmonic oscillations with a period of two years, it is
plausible that a seasonal contact rate could produce similar multiyear oscillations in the pertussis model. But this does not
happen, since the resulting oscillations in incidence have a 1 year period. However, yearly stochasticity in the contact rate does
lead to irregular oscillations in the pertussis simulation model with a period of about 4 years. Thus stochasticity is a new possible
mechanism leading to multiyear oscillations.},

sequences: the human H2 strain A/Japan/305/57, the avian Havl strain AIFPVIRostocW 
34, and the human H3 strains A/Memphis/102/72 and A/Victoria’3/75. The A/WSN HA 
gene is 1775 nucleotides in length coding for 565 amino acids. The plus strand sequence 
contains a noncoding region of 32 nucleotides at the 5’ end followed by the coding region of 
1695 nucleotides and a 3’ noncoding region of 48 nucleotides (including the UGA nonsense codon). 
The amino acid sequence derived from the nucleotide sequence shows the presence of a 17 amino 
acid long “signal” prepeptide at the amino terminus followed by an HA, of 325 amino acids, a single 
arginine connecting residue, and an HA, of 222 residues at the carboxy terminus. The comparison 
with other subtypes reveals many conserved features throughout the primary sequence in all strains 
and reinforces the argument for a basic architecture required of the entire hemagglutinin molecule. 
Comparison of the HO and H2 HAS (minus the “signal” prepeptide) shows a 67% amino acid sequence 
homology, which is the highest among the subtypes, suggesting a close geneologic relationship between the two.

   Abstract = {We used end-point-dilution cultures to measure the level of infectious human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma of 54 infected patients who were not receiving antiviral chemotherapy.

HIV-1 was recovered from the plasma and PBMC of every seropositive patient, but from none of 22 seronegative control subjects. The mean titers in plasma were 30, 3500, and 3200 tissue-culture-infective doses (TCID) per milliliter for patients with asymptomatic infection, the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and the AIDS-related complex, respectively. In PBMC, the mean titers were significantly higher for symptomatic patients (AIDS, 2200, and AIDS-related complex, 2700 TCID per 106 PBMC) than asymptomatic patients (20 TCID per 106 PBMC). The values for the symptomatic patients were considered to indicate that at least 1 in 400 circulating mononuclear cells harbored HIV-1.

The HIV-1 titers of seven patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex treated with zidovudine for four weeks decreased significantly in plasma but not in PBMC. In addition, the mean titer in the plasma of 20 patients receiving long-term zidovudine treatment (130 TCID per milliliter) was 25-fold lower than the mean for comparable untreated patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex.

We conclude that the levels of HIV-1 in plasma and PBMC are much higher than previous estimates. This high degree of HIV-1 viremia raises the possibility that the direct cytopathic effect of this retrovirus alone may be sufficient to explain much of the pathogenesis of AIDS. },

   Abstract = {Dark matter in the outer solar system, such as a hypothetical Planet X or a Kuiper belt of material outside Neptune's orbit, may be detected by its dynamical influence on the orbits of the outer planets and comets.  The study of simplified model solar systems with known observational errors offers insights into the best strategies to use in dynamical searches for dark mass, the significance of apparent anomalies, and the minimum detectable amounts of dark mass.  We use this approach to establish the following results.  (i)~The inability of modern ephemerides to predict the longitude of Neptune accurately is a consequence of Neptune's long orbital period, and provides no evidence for the existence of dark mass.  (ii)~Searching for anomalous residuals when fitting observational data to models of the solar system that do not include dark mass is an inefficient way to detect dark mass; a more powerful test (by about a factor of 3--4) is to examine the improvement in fit when the observations are fitted to models that include dark mass.  (iii)~It is much harder to locate Planet X than to detect its existence: in order to predict the location of Planet X to within $1^\circ$ its mass must exceed about 10 times the minimum detectable mass.  (iv)~If Planet X is massive and close enough to exert a detectable dynamical influence on the outer planets, then it is more likely than not that it would have been detected already in the IRAS survey.  (v)~Residuals in the orbits of comets such as Halley's are far more powerful probes for the Kuiper belt than are residuals in the orbits of the outer planets.},

   Abstract = {Social parasites may exploit their hosts by mimicking other organisms that the hosts normally benefit from investing in or responding to in some other way. Some parasites exaggerate key characters of the organisms they mimic, possibly in order to increase the response from the hosts. The huge gape and extreme begging intensity of the parasitic common cuckoo chick (Cuculus canorus) may be an example. In this paper, the evolutionary stability of manipulating hosts through exaggerated signals is analysed using game theory. Our model indicates that a parasite's signal intensity must be below a certain threshold in order to ensure acceptance and that this threshold depends directly on the rate of parasitism. The only evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) combination is when hosts accept all signallers and parasites signal at their optimal signal intensity, which must be below the threshold. Supernormal manipulation by parasites is only evolutionarily stable under sufficiently low rates of parasitism. If the conditions for the ESS combination are not satisfied, rejector hosts can invade using signal intensity as a cue for identifying parasites. These qualitative predictions are discussed with respect to empirical evidence from parasitic mimicry systems that have been suggested to involve supernormal signalling, including evicting avian brood parasites and insect-mimicking Ophrys orchids.},

   Volume = {65},
   Number = {5},
   Pages = {640-652},
   Abstract = {         1. We report the role of dispersal in the metapopulation dynamics of a protist predator-prey pair,
         the predaceous ciliate Didinium nasutum Muller feeding on the bacterivorous ciliate Colpidium cf.
         striatum Stokes. In previous work we showed that this extinction-prone pair persisted as
         metapopulations in subdivided habitats. 2. An experiment assessed the effects of habitat
         subdivision on persistence and dynamics. Undivided habitats were 270 or 750 mL in volume, and
         subdivided habitats (arrays) were sets of nine or 25 linked 30 mL bottles (270 or 750 mL total
         volume), each replicated three times. Undivided microcosms allowed maximum dispersal,
         whereas subdivision reduced dispersal. Within arrays, bottles with more connecting tubes
         allowed more dispersal. Nine and 25 bottle arrays also differed in the mean number of
         connections per bottle. The effects of dispersal on predator-prey dynamics were tested by
         comparing subdivided vs. undivided microcosms, bottles with different numbers of connecting
         tubes, and nine vs. 25 bottle arrays. 3. We tested the following predictions from metapopulation
         theory. (i) Predator and prey persistence and predator abundance will be greatest at intermediate
         dispersal rates. (ii) Prey abundance, local population variability and asynchrony in population
         fluctuations will be greatest at low dispersal rates. (iii) Predator:prey ratios will be greatest at high
         dispersal rates. 4. Predictions were confirmed, except for the following. (i) Two measures of
         synchrony differed in whether they showed the expected pattern. Spatial synchrony (estimated via
         correlation of densities among patches within sampling dates) showed high variance and did not
         vary with dispersal rates. However, spatial variability (CV of density across adjacent pairs of
         linked bottles), showed the predicted decrease with increased dispersal. (ii) Evidence that
         dispersal increases predator:prey ratios was inconclusive. Predator:prey ratios were lower in

         prey in undivided microcosms, so that both became scarce. Conversely, within arrays,
         predator:prey ratios were greatest in bottles that allowed the most dispersal, as predicted. 5. This
         work generally confirms the predicted effects of dispersal on predator-prey metapopulation
         dynamics. It also demonstrates the need for models to include more realism, e.g. the possibility of
         over- exploitation with very high dispersal.},

We prospectively followed up the first ten children with SARS managed during the early phase of the epidemic in Hong Kong. All the children had been in close contact with infected adults. Persistent fever, cough, progressive radiographic changes of chest and lymphopenia were noted in all patients. The children were treated with high-dose ribavirin, oral prednisolone, or intravenous methylprednisolone, with no short-term adverse effects. Four teenagers required oxygen therapy and two needed assisted ventilation. None of the younger children required oxygen supplementation.

Very little is known about the factors that help establish host-microbial symbiosis in this open ecosystem, By introducing single genetically manipulatable components of the microflora into germfree mice, simplified model systems have been created that will allow conversations between host and microbe to be heard and understood. Other paradigms of host-microbial symbiosis suggest that these interactions will involve an exchange of biochemical signals between host and symbionts as well as among the bacteria themselves. The integration of molecular microbiology, cell biology, and gnotobiology should provide new insights about how we adapt to a microbial world and reveal the roles played by our indigenous 'nonpathogenic' flora.

   Abstract = {Four types of observations have been used to illustrate the seasonal characteristics of epidemic influenza: (1) The experience of a small population during 28 consecutive years, 1946-74, (2) world influenza outbreaks 1964-75 reported to the World Health Organization, (3) the experience of two widely separated localities at about the same latitude, 1969-74, and (4) the experience of 
two places at latitudes 30+ on opposite sides of the Equator, 1968-74. The following tendencies are shown. (1) Outbreaks of influenza even in the small community came at approximately the same season almost every year. (2) Outbreaks are globally ubiquitous and epidemic loci move smoothly to and fro across the surface of the earth almost every year in a sinuous curve that runs parallel with the 'midsummer' curve of vertical solar radiation, but lags about six months behind it. Such findings exclude the mediation of seasonal control by any agencies of local distribution, and suggest a direct effect of variations in some 
component of solar radiation on virus or human host. (3) Antigenic variations in influenza A virus tended to have the same seasonal characteristics as epidemicity. This suggests that epidemicity and virus variation are two facets of one seasonally 
controlled process. None of these seasonal characteristics can be explained by the current concept of influenzal epidemiology. A new hypothesis recently proposed and recapitulated in the Appendix offers a possible explanation. The primary agency 
mediating seasonal control remains unidentified. },

In each outbreak, the protective effect of inactivated influenza-A vaccine was limited to those boys, not already immune, who were vaccinated for the first time with the most up-to-date strain. Revaccination with the same strain did not increase the degree of protection, and revaccination with a later strain did not afford protection against subsequent challenge. The cummulative attack-rate in the three outbreaks was similar in all groups irrespective of vaccination history. These observations suggest that annual revaccination with inactivated influenza-A vaccine confers no long-term advantage.},

   Abstract = {          We examine two methods of allocating animals between sites of different resource input rate in the
          context of the ideal free distribution. The basic models are of individuals of two classes of competitive
          weight distributing themselves between two sites. The importance of arrival sequence and the
          subsequent movements of animals between sites are investigated. When all the good competitors
          arrive before the poor competitors, the distribution of each class conforms to the input matching rule.
          When competitors arrive in a random sequence, poor competitors switch between patches. Resulting
          distributions are compared with predictions from the ideal free distribution with unequal competitors
          and from statistical mechanics. The comparisons show fewer animals using the site with the highest
          resource than predicted by the input matching rule, that is, undermatching is found. The effect of each
          animal having a unique competitive ability is then examined. We discuss the application of ideal
          free;distribution models to areas of behavioural ecology other than foraging, together with alternative
          rules to the standard instantaneous intake rates rule. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of

From the Lyapunov functions of the predator-prey system we construct new Lyapunov functions for three-level food chain models and one prey two predators models. Suppose a Lyapunov function is known for an ecological model which takes the form of an ODE system. Then we construct a Lyapunov functional for the corresponding,reactiondiffusion PDE systems. Open problems are indicated when there is gap in the theory.},

   Abstract = {We propose a compartmental disease transmission model with an asymptomatic (or subclinical) infective class to study the role of asymptomatic infection in the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases with asymptomatic infectives, e.g., influenza. Analytical results are obtained using the respective ratios of susceptible, exposed (incubating), and asymptomatic classes to the clinical symptomatic infective class. Conditions are given for bistability of equilibria to occur, where trajectories with distinct initial values could result in either a major outbreak where the disease spreads to the whole population or a lesser outbreak where some members of the population remain uninfected. This dynamic behavior did not arise in a SARS model without asymptomatic infective class studied by Hsu and Hsieh (SIAM J. Appl. Math. 66(2), 627-647, 2006). Hence, this illustrates that depending on the initial states, control of a disease outbreak with asymptomatic infections may involve more than simply reducing the reproduction number. Moreover, the presence of asymptomatic infections could result in either a positive or negative impact on the outbreak, depending on different sets of conditions on the parameters, as illustrated with numerical simulations. Biological interpretations of the analytical and numerical results are also given.},

He argues that pandemic influenza did not originate with soldiers returning from the First World War but instead traces the spread of the virus to American soldiers on their way overseas. The author posits that in Canada, the disease was then disseminated by the movement of Canadian soldiers as the war effort was widened to include a new commitment to mount an expeditionary force to Siberia. The author concludes that the physical path of the 1918 influenza pandemic in Canada is best understood as the result of a widening of the war effort at the expense of public health rather than as the inevitable consequence of the war’s end.},

   Abstract = {Class I–restricted presentation is usually associated with cytoplasmic degradation of cellular pro- 
teins and is often considered inaccessible to exogenous antigens. Nonetheless, certain exoge- 
nous elements can gain entry into this so-called endogenous pathway by a mechanism termed 
cross-presentation. This is known to be effective for class I–restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte 
(CTL) cross-priming directed against a variety of exogenous tumor, viral, and minor transplan- 
tation antigens. The related effect of cross-tolerance can also effectively eliminate responses to 
selected self components. In both cases, this presentation appears to require the active involve- 
ment of a bone marrow–derived antigen presenting cell (APC). Here, we show that CTL in- 
duction by cross-priming with cell-associated ovalbumin requires the active involvement of 
CD4 helper T cells. Importantly, this CD4 population is only effective when both the 
helper and CTL determinants are recognized on the same APC. Moreover, we would argue 
that the cognitive nature of this event suggests that the CD4 
T cell actively modifies the APC, converting it into an effective stimulator for the successful priming of the CTL precursor.},

   Abstract = {A method is presented for relating the law of rotation and density distribution of a plane disk of self-gravitating material.  The method involves the use of oblate spheroidal coordinates, and the superposition of elementary solutions of Laplace's equation due to distributions of matter on the disk.  General expressions for the law of rotation and the density-distribution are found as related series of Legendre functions.  Simple particular disk-models involving only a finite number of terms in these series can be found, the most simple being the well-known one of a uniformly rotating disk with surface density $\sigma = {\hbox constant} \times (1 - r^2/R_0^2)^{1/2}$, where $r$ is a radial coordinate and $R_0$ is the radius of the disk.  A small perturbation stability-analysis is carried out for this particular model by solving the zero-pressure hydrodynamic equations of compressible flow.  The disk is found to be unstable to an infinite number of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric modes of oscillation.},

Together with the numerical results from paper~I, and the analytic approximations in papers II and IV in the present series, an accurate description of equal mass binary-single star scattering is now available over a complete range of parameters.  An important effect of hard binaries is the heating of star clusters through three-body processes, when stellar collisions can be ignored, as is the case for encounters involving degenerate stars.  This effect is illustrated by plotting the average amount of energy exchange between binaries and field stars as a function of binary hardness.},

   Journal = {Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society},
   Volume = {205},
   Pages = {913--930},
   Abstract = {Evolution under the Fokker-Planck equation predicts that the central densities of globular clusters will become infinite in finite time with density profiles $\rho \propto r^{-\alpha}$ at that moment (and $\alpha \simeq 2.21$).  The dynamical evolution of the cores after that time, $t_0$, is predicted here.
Reasons are given why post-collapse evolution of the cores must be self-similar but with a different solution to the pre-collapse one.  General principles then predict the behaviour of the physical variables\dots
After collapse the high central density gives a short central relaxation time which leads to a nearly isothermal core with $\rho \propto r^{-2}$.  This joins the $r^{-\alpha}$ inner halo at a point where the local relaxation time is a constant fraction of the time since the collapse of the centre.  As this transition moves out through the cluster, the densities and velocity dispersions at the transition decline as detailed above.  This re-expansion of the cluster is powered by the energy released due to binary formation at the centre.  This is modelled, following H\'enon, as a point energy source.
That much can be deduced from general principles; detailed spatial profiles require a computation.  Following Hachisu \etal\ these are computed for the conductive gas model which indeed yields the expected self-similar solution.
We remark on how a distribution of stellar masses and a more detailed work on the energy output due to binaries may affect the observational predictions of such single mass models.},

Such models are natural to formulate and can be analyzed mathematically and numerically. However, difficulties associated with inference from time-series data about unknown parameters in these models have been a constraint on their application. We present a new method that makes maximum likelihood estimation feasible for partially-observed nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems (also known as state-space models) where this was not previously the case. The method is based on a sequence of filtering operations which are shown to converge to a maximum likelihood parameter estimate. We make use of recent advances in nonlinear filtering in the implementation of the algorithm. We apply the method to the study of cholera in Bangladesh. We construct confidence intervals, perform residual analysis, and apply other diagnostics. Our analysis, based upon a model capturing the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of the system, reveals some effects overlooked by previous studies.},

Seizures were considered a principal danger of fever by 49\% of physicians, and 22\% believed that brain damage could result from typical febrile seizures. While 70\% chose relief of discomfort as the main purpose of antipyretic treatment, 30\% would use temperature alone as an indication for antipyretics.

   Abstract = {Many of the simple mathematical models currently in use often fail to capture important biological factors. Here we extend current models of insect pathogen interactions to include seasonality in the birth rate. In particular, we consider the SIR model with self-regulation when applied to specific cases - rabbit haemorrhagic disease and fox rabies. In this paper, we briefly summarize the results of the model with a constant time-independent birth rate, a, which we then replace with the time dependent birth rate a(t), to investigate how this effects the dynamics of the host Population. We can split parameter space into an area in which the model without seasonality has no oscillations, in which case a simple averaging rule predicts the behaviour. Alternatively, in the area where oscillations to the equilibrium do occur in the non-seasonal model, disease persistence is more complicated and we get more complex dynamical behaviour in this case. We apply resonance techniques to discover the structure of the subharmonic modes of the SIR model with self-regulation. We then look at whether many biological systems are likely to display these "resonant" dynamics and find that we would expect them to be widespread. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Journal = {American Journal of Medicine},
   Volume = {88},
   Number = {1},
   Pages = {31-35},
   Abstract = {PURPOSE: Antipyretics are prescribed for many
hospital patients, but details concerning prescribing
practices are not known. This study was
designed to determine the incidence and format of
antipyretic orders in a university-based tertiarycare
center, and to ascertain whether orders are
correlated with patient characteristics or hospital
services.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of 300 randomly
selected patients on the medicine, general
surgery, neurosurgery, and obstetrics and gynecology
services, and of 75 patients admitted with
pneumonia and fever were retrospectively reviewed
using a standardized data form.
RESULTS: Orders for acetaminophen prn (as needed),
without further explanation, were interpreted
by the nursing staff as antipyretic orders; 78\% of
patients with such an order and fever received
acetaminophen during the febrile episode. If orders
of this type were included, 153 (51\%) of the randomly
selected patients received an antipyretic order.
Gender, age, duration of hospitilzation, intensive
care unit residence, fever, and presence of a
condition worsened by fever were not significant
independent predictors of antipyretic prescription,
but documented infection and hospitalization on
the medicine and neurosurgery services were, with
adjusted odds ratios of 2.5 (95\% confidence interval
[CI] 1.3 to 5.0), 9.4 (95\% CI 3.6 to 25), and 14 (95\%
CI 5.0 to 41), respectively. Of patients who received
an antipyretic order, 70\% had an admission order
for antipyretics; 26\%, an order prompted by fever;
and 79\%, an order while afebrile. In 86\%, the order
was written prn without further explanation.
Around-the-clock dosing, automatic stop orders,
and acknowledgement and justification of orders
were rare.
CONCLUSION: Antipyretic orders are routine and
correlate more strongly with hospital service than
with individual patient characteristics. They are
imprecisely written and generally leave decisions
about antipyretic administration to the complete
discretion of the nursing staff.},

   Abstract = {We formulate and analyze a mathematical model describing immune response to avascular tumor under the influence of immunotherapy and chemotherapy and their combinations as well as vaccine treatments. The effect of vaccine therapy is considered as a parametric perturbation of the model. In the case of a weak immune response, neither immunotherapy nor chemotherapy is found to cause tumor regression to a small size, which would be below the clinically detectable threshold. Numerical simulations show that the efficiency of vaccine therapy depends on both the tumor size and the condition of immune system as well as on the response of the organism to vaccination. In particular, we found that vaccine therapy becomes more effective when used without time delay from a prescribed date of vaccination after surgery and is ineffective without preliminary treatment. For a strong immune response, our model predicts the tumor remission under vaccine therapy. Our study of successive chemo/immuno, immuno/chemo and concurrent chemoimmunotherapy shows that the chemo/immuno sequence is more effective while concurrent chemoimmunotherapy is more sparing.},

The role of induced heritable variation in evolution therefore needs to be reconsidered, and the evolution of the systems that produce induced variation needs to be studied.},

   Abstract = {The transmissibility of the strain of influenza virus which caused the 1968 influenza pandemic is poorly un- derstood. Increases in outbreak size between the first and second waves suggest that it may even have increased between successive waves. The authors estimated basic and effective reproduction numbers for both waves of the 1968 influenza pandemic. Epidemic curves and overall attack rates for the 1968 pandemic, based on clinical and serologic data, were retrieved from published literature. The basic and effective reproduction numbers were estimated from 46 and 17 data sets for the first and second waves, respectively, based on the growth rate and/ or final size of the epidemic. Estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) were in the range of 1.06–2.06 for the first wave and, assuming cross-protection, 1.21–3.58 in the second. Within each wave, there was little geographic variation in transmissibility. In the 10 settings for which data were available for both waves, R0 was estimated to be higher during the second wave than during the first. This might partly explain the larger outbreaks in the second wave as compared with the first. This potential for change in viral behavior may have consequences for future pandemic mitigation strategies.},

We describe the clinical characteristics of patients who were hospitalized with 2009 H1N1 influenza in the United States from April 2009 to mid-June 2009. Using medical charts, we collected data on 272 patients who were hospitalized for at least 24 hours for influenza-like illness and who tested positive for the 2009 H1N1 virus with the use of a real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction assay. Of the 272 patients we studied, 25\% were admitted to an intensive care unit and 7\% died. Forty-five percent of the patients were children under the age of 18 years, and 5\% were 65 years of age or older. Seventy-three percent of the patients had at least one underlying medical condition; these conditions included asthma; diabetes; heart, lung, and neurologic diseases; and pregnancy. Of the 249 patients who underwent chest radiography on admission, 100 (40\%) had findings consistent with pneumonia. Of the 268 patients for whom data were available regarding the use of antiviral drugs, such therapy was initiated in 200 patients (75\%) at a median of 3 days after the onset of illness. Data suggest that the use of antiviral drugs was beneficial in hospitalized patients, especially when such therapy was initiated early. During the evaluation period, 2009 H1N1 influenza caused severe illness requiring hospitalization, including pneumonia and death. Nearly three quarters of the patients had one or more underlying medical conditions. Few severe illnesses were reported among persons 65 years of age or older. Patients seemed to benefit from antiviral therapy.},

High coverage (> 95%) is achieved with both doses. In order to assess progress towards measles elimination in Poland, a serological survey was performed to evaluate the impact of vaccination on the susceptibility profile of population. Three thousand residual serum samples from individuals aged 1-30 years were collected from hospitals in six selected voivodeships (administration units) in Poland. These were tested for measles-specific IgG using a commercial ELISA. Overall 4% (120/3000) were negative for measles virus antibody. The highest proportion of negatives (8.2%) occurred among cohorts born 1977-81 - the only cohorts in which susceptibility exceeded the WHO targets. 'Catch-up' vaccination strategies should target these cohorts.},

   Abstract = {Epidemiology is one of the areas in biology to which mathematical modeling has been applied most successfully. It was through the mathematical concept of basic reproductive number that Ronald Ross gained the insight that malaria could be controlled if the mosquito population was sufficiently suppressed (Heesterbeek 2002). Later, similar concepts were applied to the eradication of smallpox and the control of many viral diseases through vaccination campaigns (Anderson and May 1991). To date, mathematical models remain an important tool. Epidemiology studies the distribution of a disease within a host population. Most models used for infectious diseases are based on partitioning the host population into different classes that correspond to the different stages of the infectious process (e.g., susceptible, infectious, and recovered) and the transitions between these classes. Such models work particularly well for diseases caused by microparasites, a class of pathogens that comprises viruses and bacteria and that are characterized by an infection normally accomplished with a single dose that consists of a relatively small number of infective particles (Anderson and May 1991). Mathematical epidemiology has concentrated on cases for which the disease is endemic or in which large epidemics occur. In this context the reproductive number is an important parameter. It is defined as the average number of secondary infections caused by an infected host over the lifetime of the infection. In a completely susceptible population, this number is known as the basic reproductive number, R0. If the reproductive number is larger than one, a single infection can lead to a chain reaction of infections and, eventually, to an epidemic or an endemic state. If the reproductive number is smaller than one, large epidemics do not occur and the pathogen is bound to disappear from the population. If the basic reproductive number is less than one, the numbers of infected individuals hardly ever become truly large and stochastic effects prevail. If this is the case the disease manifests itself in the form of outbreaks that follow the introduction of the disease into the population. The size and duration of an outbreak can vary enormously through chance events. To capture these dynamics a stochastic formalism is needed. In this section we illustrate how the theory of branching processes can be used to describe the epidemiology of pathogens with a reproductive number smaller than one, using the epidemiology of measles as an example. We use this to explain the distribution of disease outbreaks in small island populations, and the effect of a recent decline in vaccination in the UK after a scare about vaccine safety.},

   Abstract = {Background We aimed to assess evidence of efficacy and effectiveness of live attenuated and inactivated influenza vaccines in children up to 16 years of age.
Methods We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE Biological Abstracts, and Science Citation Index to June, 2004, in any language, and contacted vaccine manufacturers and authors of relevant studies to identify additional data. We included randomised, cohort, and case-control studies comparing efficacy of vaccines against influenza (reduction in laboratory-confirmed cases), effectiveness of vaccines against influenza-like illness (reduction in symptomatic cases), or both, with placebo or no intervention. We analysed the following outcomes: influenza, influenza-like illness, admissions, school absences, complications, and secondary transmission.
Findings We included 14 randomised controlled trials, eight cohort studies, one case-control study, and one randomised controlled trial of intraepidemic use of the vaccines. Live attenuated influenza vaccines had 79% efficacy and 38% effectiveness in children older than 2 years compared with placebo or no immunisation. Inactivated vaccines had lower efficacy (65%) than live attenuated vaccines, and in children aged 2 years or younger they had similar effects to placebo. Effectiveness of inactivated vaccines was about 28% in children older than 2 years. Vaccines were effective in reducing long school absences (relative risk 0·14 [95% CI 0·070·27]). Studies assessing the effects of vaccines against secondary cases, lower-respiratory tract disease, acute otitis media, and hospital stay suggested no difference with placebo or standard care, but lacked statistical power.
Interpretation Influenza vaccines (especially two-dose live attenuated vaccines) are efficacious in children older than 2 years. Efficacy and effectiveness of the vaccines differed strikingly. Only two small studies assessed the effects of influenza vaccines on hospital admissions and no studies assessed reductions in mortality, serious complications, and community transmission of influenza. If influenza immunisation in children is to be recommended as public-health policy, large-scale studies assessing such important outcomes and undertaking direct comparisons of vaccines are urgently needed.},

Design A systematic search of Medline, Embase, and The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials was undertaken to identify in vivo animal experiments or randomised, controlled trials in humans of antipyretic medication in S pneumoniae infection which reported mortality data. Meta-analysis was by inverse variance weighted method for odds ratios.
Setting Antipyretics are recommended for the symptomatic treatment of various diseases caused by S pneumoniae. However, there is evidence that fever is a protective physiological response to infection, that treating fever secondary to infection may be harmful, and that some strains of S pneumoniae are temperature sensitive.
Main outcome measures Mortality associated with antipyretic use in S pneumoniae infection.
Results Four studies from two publications met the inclusion criteria and investigated the use of aspirin in animal models. The pooled estimate of mortality was an OR with aspirin treatment of 1.97 (95\% CI 1.22 to 3.19). There were no suitable human studies identified.
Conclusions A twofold increased risk of mortality was found with aspirin treatment in animal models of S pneumoniae infection. No relevant human studies were identified. It is difficult to generalise from animal models to clinical medicine, but based on these findings and the prevalence and severity of S pneumoniae infections worldwide, future study of the effects of antipyretic therapy in S pneumoniae infection in humans is recommended.},

   Abstract = {Scientific reviewing methods were applied to economic studies of influenza vaccination, and an economic model of influenza vaccination was developed from these primary sources. Issues arising from the secondary literature review include the quality of evidence on the effectiveness of the vaccines, the absence of a traditional population-based approach to reviewing economic data, confusion in terminology, and how to generalise from resource data contained in primary evaluations. Data from the literature review were summarised in terms of resource units used in the prevention and treatment of influenza. An economic model was constructed using local unit costs (from the Emilia region of Italy) and applying the data to a notional population. The model was sensitive to length of stay in hospital but not to variation in incidence of influenza, days off work or number of medical consultations. The model was predicated on and is sensitive to an estimate of 80% vaccine effectiveness. The approach is constrained by the available data, but could be more generally useful in that it allows variations in the quantity of inputs to be considered separately from variations in their values. The model may be used locally as a decision-making tool, although the method needs further development.},

For any automaton rule, an associated ``filtering'' rule is defined for which the only attractors are spatial sequences consisting of concatenations of invariant strings.

   Abstract = {A one-dimensional cellular automaton with periodic boundary conditions may be viewed as a lattice of sites on a cylinder evolving according to a local interaction rule.  A technique is described for finding analytically the set of attractors for such an automaton.  Given any one-dimensional automaton rule, a matrix $A$  is defined such that the number of fixed points on an arbitrary cylinder size is given by the trace of $A^n$, where the power $n$ depends linearly on the cylinder size.  More generally, the number of strings of arbitrary length that appear in limit cycles of any fixed period is found as the solution of a linear recurrence relation derived from the chracteristic equation of an associated matrix.  The technique thus make it possible, for any rule, to compute the numbed of limit cycles of any period on any cylinder size.  To illustrate the technique, closed-form expressions are provided for the complete attractor structure of all two-neighbor rules.  The analysis of attractors also identifies shifts as a basic mechanism underlying periodic behavior.  Every limit cycle can be equivalently defined as a set of strings on which the action of the rule is a shift of size $s/h$; \ie each string cyclically shifts by $s$ sites in $h$ iterations of the rule.  The study of shifts provides detailed information on the structure and number of limit cycles for one-dimensional automata.},

   Abstract = {A one-dimensional linear cellular automaton with periodic boundary conditions consists of a lattice of sites on a cylinder evolving according to a linear local interaction rule.  Limit cycles for such system are studied as sets of strings on which the rule acts as a shift of size $s/h$; \ie each string in the limit cycle cyclically shifts by $s$ sites in $h$ iterations of the rule.  For any given rule, the size of the shift varies with the cylinder size $n$.  The analysis of shifts establishes an equivalence between the strings of values appearing in limit cycles for these automata, and linear recurring sequences in finite fields.  Specifically, it is shown that a string appears in a limit cycle for a linear automaton rule on a cylinder size $n$ iff its values satisfy a linear recurrence relation defined by the shift value for that $n$.  The rich body of results on recurring sequences and finite fields can then be used to obtain detailed information on periodic behavior of these sytems.  Topics considered here include the inverse problem of identifying the set of linear automata rules for which a given string appears in a limit cycle, and the structure under operations (such as addition and complementation) of sets of limit cycle strings.},

   Abstract = {The quasispecies model of RNA virus evolution differs from those formulated in conventional population genetics in that neutral mutations do not lead to genetic drift of the population, and natural selection acts on the mutant distribution as a whole rather than on individual variants. By computer simulation, we show that this model could be inappropriate for many RNA viruses because the neutral sequence space may be too large to allow the formation of a quasispecies distribution. This view is supported by our analysis of gene sequences from vesicular stomatitis virus, which is considered a prototype RNA virus quasispecies. Our results are relevant to the evolution of RNA systems in general.},

   Abstract = {The process of nonindigenous species (NIS) arrival has received limited theoretical consideration despite importance in predicting
and preventing the establishment of NIS. We formulate a mechanistically based hierarchical model of NIS arrival and demonstrate
simplifications leading to a marginal distribution of the number of surviving introduced individuals from parameters of survival
probability and propagule pressure. The marginal distribution is extended as a stochastic process from which establishment emerges
with a waiting time distribution. This provides a probability of NIS establishment within a specified period and may be useful for identifying
patterns of successful invaders. However, estimates of both the propagule pressure and the individual survival probability are
rarely available for NIS, making estimates of the probability of establishment difficult. Alternatively, researchers are able to measure
proportional estimates of propagule pressure through models of NIS transport, such as gravity models, or of survival probability through habitat-matching indexes measuring the similarity between potentially occupied and native NIS ranges. Therefore, we formulate the
relative waiting time between two locations and the probability of one location being invaded before the other.},

   Abstract = {Enantiostyly is the deflection of the female sex organ either to the left or to the right side of the floral axis, resulting in mirror-image flowers. Two types of enantiostyly occur: in monomorphic enantiostyly, individuals exhibit both flower forms, whereas in dimorphic enantiostyly, the forms occur on separate plants. Monomorphic enantiostyly is known from at least 10 families, whereas dimorphic enantiostyly is reported in only three. Phylogenetic evidence suggests that monomorphic enantiostyly has evolved from a straight-styled ancestor and that dimorphic enantiostyly is derived from monomorphic enantiostyly. Here, we use theoretical models to investigate the role of pollen transfer in influencing these evolutionary transitions. We used numerical calculations to examine the evolution of monomorphic and dimorphic enantiostyly under different conditions of pollen transfer, inbreeding depression, and pollinator visitation. Our results demonstrate that in comparison to a p!  utative straight-styled ancestor, both monomorphic and dimorphic enantiostyly function to reduce geitonogamous pollen transfer with a concomitant increase in pollen export. Our calculations suggest that the first stage in the evolution of monomorphic enantiostyly involves the deflection of the style only, followed by selection for reciprocity in anther position to promote more precise cross- pollination. Constraints associated with the developmental genetics of left-right asymmetries may account for the low number of evolutionary transitions from monomorphic to dimorphic enantiostyly, despite the evolutionary stability of this condition once it arises.},

   Volume = {1},

   Pages = {Article 2},
   Abstract = {Backcalculation is a technique that was originally developed for the study of HIV incidence. Here we introduce some variants of the estimation technique that allow for (i) correlation of the unobserved disease incidence counts, and (ii) the use of a smoothing step as part of the maximizing step in the EM algorithm to reduce instability due to small diagnosis counts. Both of these issues can be important in the analysis of small “epidemics”. In addition, identification of correlation between diagnosis counts provides indirect evidence of correlation among unobserved incidence counts, hinting at the possibility of an infectious agent. We illustrate the ideas by reconstructing an incidence intensity function for the onset of multiple sclerosis, using data from the Faroe Islands. Previously, this data had been examined statistically, by Joseph, Wolfson & Wolfson (1990), to address the issue of infectiousness of multiple sclerosis. We argue that the incidence function cannot directly shed light on the enigmatic origin of multiple sclerosis in the Faroe Islands during World War II, and, in particular, cannot discriminate between hypotheses of an infectious or environmental agent.},

   Volume = {71},
   Pages = {845-862},
   Abstract = {There are numerous examples of human pathogens which persist in environmental reservoirs while infectious outbreaks remain rare. In this manuscript, we consider the dynamics of infectious diseases for which the primary mode of transmission is indirect and mediated by contact with a contaminated reservoir. We evaluate the realistic scenario in which the number of ingested pathogens must be above a critical threshold to cause infection in susceptible individuals. This minimal infectious dose is a consequence of the clearance effect of the innate immune system. Infected individuals shed pathogens back into the aquatic reservoir, indirectly increasing the transmittability of the pathogen to the susceptible. Building upon prior works in the study of cholera dynamics, we introduce and analyze a family of reservoir mediated SIR models with a threshold pathogen den- sity for infection. Analyzing this family of models, we show that an outbreak can result from noninfinitesimal introductions of either infected individuals or additional pathogens in the reservoir. We devise two new measures of how likely it is that an environmen- tally persistent pathogen will cause an outbreak: (i) the minimum fraction of infected individuals; and (ii) the minimum fluctuation size of in-reservoir pathogens. We find an additional control parameter involving the shedding rate of infected individuals, which we term the pathogen enhancement ratio, which determines whether outbreaks lead to epidemics or endemic disease states. Thus, the ultimate outcome of disease is controlled by the strength of fluctuations and the global stability of a nonlinear dynamical system, as opposed to conventional analysis in which disease reflects the linear destabilization of a disease free equilibrium. Our model predicts that in the case of waterborne diseases, suppressing the pathogen density in aquatic reservoirs may be more effective than minimizing the number of infected individuals.},

Data on hospitalizations and deaths are from the Hospital Mortality Data Base and the Canadian Mortality Data Base, respectively. ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES: Cross-tabulations were used to estimate rates of vaccination among seniors, people with chronic conditions, and the total population aged 20 or older. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess relationships between being vaccinated and selected characteristics. MAIN RESULTS: Between 1996/97 and 2000/01, the percentage of Canadians aged 20 or older who reported having had a flu shot the previous year rose from 16% to 28%. Rates were higher for seniors and people with chronic conditions. The odds of vaccination were high for residents of middle-to-high income households, people with at least some postsecondary education, former smokers, and people with a regular doctor. Smokers and people who reported their health as good to excellent had lower odds of being vaccinated.},

   Abstract = {When the Expanded Programme on Immunization was established and oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) was introduced for developing countries to use exclusively, national leaders of public health had no opportunity to make an informed choice between OPV and the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), Today, as progress is made towards the goal of global eradication of poliomyelitis attributable to wild polioviruses, all developing countries where OPV is used face the risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP). Until recently, awareness of VAPP has been poor and quantitative risk analysis scanty but it is now well known that the continued use of OPV perpetuates the risk of VAPP. Discontinuation or declining immunization coverage of OPV will increase the risk of emergence of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV) that re-acquire wild virus-like properties and may cause outbreaks of polio. To eliminate the risk of cVDPV, either very high immunization coverage must be maintained as long as OPV is in use, or IPV should replace OPV. Stopping OPV without first achieving high immunization coverage with IPV is unwise on account of the possibility of emergence of cVDPV. Increasing numbers of developed nations prefer IPV, and manufacturing capacities have not been scaled up, so its price remains prohibitively high and unaffordable by developing countries, where, in addition, large-scale field experience with IPV is lacking. Under these circumstances, a policy shift to increase the use of IPV in national immunization programmes in developing countries is a necessary first step; once IPV coverage reaches high levels (over 85%), the withdrawal of OPV may begin.},

   Abstract = {A model of mutual mate choice is described, 
formulated as a dynamic game, which yields predictions 
about mating behaviour under the inﬂuence of time 
constraints, choice costs and competition for mates. 
These variables were examined because they may result 
in a change in the distribution of qualities among un- 
mated individuals of both sexes over the course of the 
breeding season. The model predicts that mutual choice 
gives rise to assortative mating, although high costs of 
choice and/or inaccurate assessment both lead to lower 
overall correlations between the qualities (or the at- 
tractiveness) of mates. When all individuals are present 
from the start of the breeding season, the correlation 
between the qualities of individuals pairing at a given 
time declines throughout the season, so that mates are 
more closely matched among individuals who pair early 
than among those who pair late (and extra-pair copu- 
lation may thus be more common among the latter). 
Delayed arrival of lower-quality individuals may, how- 
ever, lead to an increase in this correlation with time 
during the early part of the season. The mean quality of 
unmated males and females declines over time, because 
more attractive individuals tend to mate sooner. As a 
result of this decline, and because of time constraints, 
superior individuals become less choosy as the season 
progresses. If choice is costly, however, then inferior 
individuals become more selective with time during the 
early part of the season, and the level of choosiness 
peaks later for such individuals. },

   Abstract = {When members of a group differ in their preferred course of action, coordination poses a challenge. Leadership offers one way to resolve this difficulty, but the evolution of leaders and followers is itself poorly understood. Existing discussions have frequently attributed leadership to differences in information or need among individuals. Here, however, we show that in an n-player, repeated coordination game, selection leads to evolutionary branching and diversification in intrinsic leadership among the members of a population even in the absence of any variation in state. When individuals interact in pairs, repeated branching is possible; when individuals interact in larger groups, the typical outcome is a single branching event leading to a dimorphism featuring extreme intrinsic leaders and followers. These personality types emerge and are maintained by frequency-dependent selection, because leaders gain by imposing their preferences on followers, but fail to coordinate effectively when interacting with other leaders. The fraction of intrinsic leaders in the population increases with the degree of conflict among group members, with both types common only at intermediate levels of conflict; when conflict is weak, most individuals are intrinsic followers, and groups achieve high levels of coordination by randomly converging on one individual's preferred option, whereas when conflict is strong, most individuals are intrinsic leaders, and coordination breaks down because members of a group are rarely willing to follow another.},

The recorded statistics of influenza morbidity and mortality are likely to be a significant understatement. Limitations of these data can include nonregistration, missing records, misdiagnosis, and nonmedical certification, and may also vary greatly between locations. Further research has seen the consistent upward revision of the estimated global mortality of the pandemic, which a 1920s calculation put in the vicinity of 21.5 million. A 1991 paper revised the mortality as being in the range 24.7- 39.3 million. This paper suggests that it was of the order of 50 million.

   Pages = {13-21},
   Abstract = {This paper tests the hypothesis that systems at the edge of chaos have the highest level of(thermodynamic) information, which supports the hypothesis that systems at the edge of the chaos can coordinate the most complex behavior. This is examined by the use of a realistic ecological lake model describing how an ecological system behaves (i.e. chaotic or ordered), and how the level of information in the system changes when some of the key properties of the focal classes of species are changed. The highest level of information (which is also Furthest from thermodynamic equilibrium, as information processes free energy) coincides with realistic properties (parameters) and with a system at the edge of the chaos. The model's key parameter was chosen as the maximum growth rate of zooplankton, as from lake studies, zooplankton growth rate reflects the conditions in the ecosystem and that different zooplankton species have different growth rates. If the key parameter is given a slightly higher value, chaotic behavior emerges. If fish is introduced to the system, the maximum information of the system increases. The maximum zooplankton growth rate giving the highest level of information is reduced if fish are present. This is in accordance with general observations-thus supporting the results.

The specific aims are (1)~to follow the growths of the perturbations of individual particles in the simulation, analyzing their statistical properties, (2)~to investigate how these statistical properties vary as the number of particles $N$ in the simulation is changed from 16 to 340, and (3)~to determine how these properties vary if one changes the ``softening parameter.''  Principal conclusions obtained for the simulations considered include the following: (1)~The mean $e$-folding time $t_*$ for the perturbation in the location of some particle is comparable to the dynamical, or crossing, time $t_{\rm cr}$ for all $N$.  (2)~There is, however, a weak $N$-dependence, $t_*/t_{\rm cr}$ decreasing as $N$ increases but tending towards an asymptotic value for large $N$.  (3)~The distribution of $e$-folding times for a given $N$ has a distinctive and comparatively reproducible shape, the reproducibility improving as $N$ grows.  (4)~Increasing the ``softening parameter'' leads to a systematic increase in $t_*$, but this time scale remains comparable to $t_{\rm cr}$ even when the ``softening parameter'' becomes so large as to be comparable to the interparticle spacing.},

We embed this traced vaccination policy in a smallpox disease transmission model to estimate the number of cases and deaths that would result from an attack in a large urban area. Comparing the results to mass vaccination from the moment an attack is recognized, we find that mass vaccination results in both far fewer deaths and much faster epidemic eradication over a wide range of disease and intervention policy parameters, including those believed most likely, and that mass vaccination similarly outperforms the existing policy of starting with traced vaccination and switching to mass vaccination only if required.},

   Abstract = {To evaluate existing and alternative proposals for emergency response to a deliberate smallpox attack, we embed the key operational features of such interventions into a smallpox disease transmission model. We use probabilistic reasoning within an otherwise deterministic epidemic framework to model the 'race to trace', i.e., attempting to trace (via the infector) and vaccinate an infected person while (s)he is still vaccine-sensitive. Our model explicitly incorporates a tracing/vaccination queue, and hence can be used as a capacity planning tool. An approximate analysis of this large (16 ODE) system yields closed-form estimates for the total number of deaths and the maximum queue length. The former estimate delineates the efficacy (i.e., accuracy) and efficiency (i.e., speed) of contact tracing, while the latter estimate reveals how congestion makes the race to trace more difficult to win, thereby causing more deaths. A probabilistic analysis is also used to find an approximate closed-form expression for the total number of deaths under mass vaccination, in terms of both the basic reproductive ratio and the vaccination capacity. We also derive approximate thresholds for initially controlling the epidemic for more general interventions that include imperfect vaccination and quarantine. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

   Abstract = {The phase space for Hamiltonians of two degrees of freedom is usually divided into stochastic and integrable components.  Even when well into the stochastic regime, integrable orbits may surround small stable regions or islands.  The effect of these islands on the correlation function for the stochastic trajectories is examined.  Depending on the value of the parameter describing the rotation number for the elliptic fixed point at the center of the island, the long-time correlation function may decay as $t^{-5}$ or exponentially, but more commonly it decays much more slowly (roughly as $t^{-1}$).  As a consequence these small islands may have a profound effect on the properties of the stochastic orbits.  In particular, there is evidence that the evolution of a distribution of particles is no longer governed by a diffusion equation.},

   Pages = {DOI 10.1007/s00285-011-0460-2},
   Abstract = {We formulate and study a general epidemic model allowing for an arbitrary distribution of susceptibility in the population. We derive the final-size equation which determines the attack rate of the epidemic, somewhat generalizing previous work. Our main aim is to use this equation to investigate how properties of the susceptibility distribution affect the attack rate. Defining an ordering among susceptibility distributions in terms of their Laplace transforms, we show that a susceptibility distribution dominates another in this ordering if and only if the corresponding attack rates are ordered for every value of the reproductive number R0 . This result is used to prove a sharp universal upper bound for the attack rate valid for any susceptibility distribution, in terms of R0 alone, and a sharp lower bound in terms of R0 and the coefficient of variation of the susceptibility distribution. We apply some of these results to study two issues of epidemiological interest in a population with heterogeneous susceptibility: (1) the effect of vaccination of a fraction of the population with a partially effective vaccine, (2) the effect of an epidemic of a pathogen inducing partial immunity on the possibility and size of a future epidemic. In the latter case, we prove a surprising '50\% law': if infection by a pathogen induces a partial immunity reducing susceptibility by less than 50\%, then, whatever the value of R0 > 1 before the first epidemic, a second epidemic will occur, while if susceptibility is reduced by more than 50\%, then a second epidemic will only occur if R0 is larger than a certain critical value greater than 1.},

   Journal = {Journal of the Royal Society Interface},
   Volume = {8},
   Number = {59},
   Pages = {856-867},
   Abstract = {This paper presents new computational and modelling tools for studying the dynamics of an epidemic in its initial stages that use both available incidence time series and data describing the population's infection network structure. The work is motivated by data collected at the beginning of the H1N1 pandemic outbreak in Israel in the summer of 2009. We formulated a new discrete-time stochastic epidemic SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model that explicitly takes into account the disease's specific generation-time distribution and the intrinsic demographic stochasticity inherent to the infection process. Moreover, in contrast with many other modelling approaches, the model allows direct analytical derivation of estimates for the effective reproductive number (R(e)) and of their credible intervals, by maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. The basic model can be extended to include age-class structure, and a maximum likelihood methodology allows us to estimate the model's next-generation matrix by combining two types of data: (i) the incidence series of each age group, and (ii) infection network data that provide partial information of 'who-infected-who'. Unlike other approaches for estimating the next-generation matrix, the method developed here does not require making a priori assumptions about the structure of the next-generation matrix. We show, using a simulation study, that even a relatively small amount of information about the infection network greatly improves the accuracy of estimation of the next-generation matrix. The method is applied in practice to estimate the next-generation matrix from the Israeli H1N1 pandemic data. The tools developed here should be of practical importance for future investigations of epidemics during their initial stages. However, they require the availability of data which represent a random sample of the real epidemic process. We discuss the conditions under which reporting rates may or may not influence our estimated quantities and the effects of bias.},

The Eurowinter study aimed to assess whether increases in mortality per 1 degrees C fall in temperature differ in various European regions and to relate any differences to usual winter climate and measures to protect against cold.Methods Percentage increases in deaths per day per 1 degrees C fall in temperature below 18 degrees C (indices of cold-related mortality) were estimated by generalised linear modelling. We assessed protective factors by surveys and adjusted by regression to 7 degrees C outdoor temperature. Cause-specific data gathered from 1988 to 1992 were analysed by multiple regression for men and women aged 50-59 and 65-74 in north Finland, south Finland, Baden-Wurttemburg, the Netherlands, London, and north Italy (24 groups). We used a similar method to analyse 1992 data in Athens and Palermo.Findings The percentage increases in all-cause mortality per 1 degrees C fall in temperature below 18 degrees C were greater in warmer regions than in colder regions (eg, Athens 2.15% [95% CI 1.20-3.10] vs south Finland 0.27% [0.15-0.40]). At an outdoor temperature of 7 degrees C, the mean living-room temperature was 19.2 degrees C in Athens and 21.7 degrees C in south Finland; 13% and 72% of people in these regions, respectively, wore hats when outdoors at 7 degrees C. Multiple regression analyses (with allowance for sex and age, in the six regions with full data) showed that high indices of cold-related mortality were associated with high mean winter temperatures, low living-room temperatures, limited bedroom heating, low proportions of people wearing hats, gloves, and anoraks, and inactivity and shivering when outdoors at 7 degrees C (p<0.01 for all-cause mortality and respiratory mortality; p>0.05 for mortality from ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease).Interpretation Mortality increased to a greater extent with given fall of temperature in regions with warm winters, in populations with cooler homes, and among people who wore fewer clothes and were less active outdoors.},

Three key features common to many biological systems are temporal forcing, stochasticity and nonlinearity. Here, using simple disease models compared to data, we examine how these three factors interact to produce a range of complicated dynamics. The study of disease dynamics has been amongst the most theoretically developed areas of mathematical biology; simple models have been highly successful in explaining the dynamics of a wide variety of diseases. Models of childhood diseases incorporate seasonal variation in contact rates due to the increased mixing during school terms compared to school holidays. This 'binary' nature of the seasonal forcing results in dynamics that can be explained as switching between two nonlinear spiral sinks. Finally, we consider the stability of the attractors to understand the interaction between the deterministic dynamics and demographic and environmental stochasticity. Throughout attention is focused on the behaviour of measles, whooping cough and rubella. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

   Abstract = {John Donne's famous line “No man is an island, entire of itself” has deep resonances for the dynamics of parasites. This is particularly true for microparasitic infections, such as viruses and bacteria, for which each susceptible host is a potential patch of favourable habitat. Propagules from infected “patches” can colonize others, followed by parasitic multiplication and “local” growth of the parasite population. Thus, at the scale of the host population, infectious dynamics bears strong analogies to metapopulation dynamics. Furthermore, host individuals are, more often than not, structured into local populations, within which contact among hosts may be very frequent and between which contacts may be less frequent. In this way, the spatiotemporal dynamics and persistence of parasites are determined at two scales: the infrapopulation scale (a local population scale; parasites within hosts) and the metapopulation scale (spatial and/or social aggregation of hosts). The spatiotemporal dynamics of infection in human and domestic systems are of particular academic interest because of the wealth of data combined with well-described natural histories.},

   Abstract = {Bubonic plague (Yersinia pestis) is generally thought of as a historical disease; however, it is still responsible for around 1000 -3000 deaths each year worldwide. This paper expands the analysis of a model for bubonic plague that encompasses the disease dynamics in rat, flea and human populations. Some key variables of the the deterministic model, including the force of infection to humans, are shown to be robust to changes ill the basic parameters, although variation in the flea searching efficiency and the movement rates of rats and fleas will be considered throughout the pal,cr. The stochastic behaviour of the corresponding metapopulation model is discussed, with attention focused on the dynamics of rats and the force of infection at the local spatial scale. Short-lived local epidemics in rats govern the invasion of the disease and produce an irregular pattern of human cases similar to those observed. However; the endemic behaviour in a few rat subpopulations allows the disease to persist for many years. This spatial stochastic model is also used to identify the criteria for the spread to human populations in terms of the rat density. Finally, the full stochastic model is reduced to the form of a probabilistic cellular automaton, which allows the analysis of a large number of replicated epidemics in large populations. This simplified model enables us to analyse the spatial properties of rat epidemics and the effects of movement rates, and also to test whether the emergent metapopulation behaviour is a property of the local dynamics rather than the precise details of the model.},

   Abstract = {Ever since the pattern of localized extinction associated with measles was discovered by Bartlett in 1957, many models have been developed in an attempt to reproduce this phenomenon. Recently, the use of constant infectious and incubation periods, rather than the more convenient exponential forms, has been presented as a simple means of obtaining realistic persistence levels. However, this result appears at odds with rigorous mathematical theory; here we reconcile these differences. Using a deterministic approach, we parameterize a variety of models to fit the observed biennial attractor, thus determining the level of seasonality by the choice of model. We can then compare fairly the persistence of the stochastic versions of these models, using the 'best-fit' parameters. Finally, we consider the differences between the observed fade- out pattern and the more theoretically appealing 'first passage time'.},

   Abstract = {Models that deal with the individual level of populations have shown the importance of stochasticity in ecology, epidemiology and evolution. An increasingly common approach to studying these models is through stochastic (event-driven) simulation. One striking disadvantage of this approach is the need for a large number of replicates to determine the range of expected behaviour. Here, for a class of stochastic models called Markov processes, we present results that overcome this difficulty and provide valuable insights, but which have been largely ignored by applied researchers. For these models, the so- called Kolmogorov forward equation (also called the ensemble or master equation) allows one to simultaneously consider the probability of each possible state occurring. Irrespective of the complexities and nonlinearities of population dynamics, this equation is linear and has a natural matrix formulation that provides many analytical insights into the behaviour of stochastic populations and allows rapid evaluation of process dynamics. Here, using epidemiological models as a template, these ensemble equations are explored and results are compared with traditional stochastic simulations. In addition, we describe further advantages of the matrix formulation of dynamics, providing simple exact methods for evaluating expected eradication (extinction) times of diseases, for comparing expected total costs of possible control programmes and for estimation of disease parameters.},

   Pages = {1789-1805},
   Abstract = {Population cycles have long fascinated ecologists. Even in the most-studied populations, however, scientists continue to dispute the relative importance of various potential causes of the cycles, Over the past three decades, theoretical ecologists have cataloged a large number of mechanisms that are capable of generating cycles in population models. At the same time, statisticians have developed new techniques both for characterizing time series and for fitting population models to time-series data. Both disciplines are now sufficiently advanced that great gains in understanding can be made by synthesizing these complementary, and heretofore mostly independent, quantitative approaches. In this paper we demonstrate how to apply this synthesis to the problem of population cycles, using both long-term population time series and the often-rich observational and experimental data on the ecology of the species in question. We quantify hypotheses by writing mathematical models that embody the interactions and forces that might cause cycles. Some hypotheses can be rejected out of hand, as being unable to generate even qualitatively appropriate dynamics, We finish quantifying the remaining hypotheses by estimating parameters, both from independent experiments and from fitting the models to the time-series data using modern statistical techniques, Finally, we compare simulated time series generated by the models to the observed time series, using a variety of statistical descriptors, which we refer to collectively as "probes." The model most similar to the data, as measured by these probes, is considered to be the most likely candidate to represent the mechanism underlying the population cycles. We illustrate this approach by analyzing one of Nicholson's blowfly populations, in which we know the "true" governing mechanism. Our analysis, which uses only a subset of the information available about the population, uncovers the correct answer, suggesting that this synthetic approach might be successfully applied to field populations as well.},

   Abstract = {Inflammatory processes are essential for recruiting leukocytes to the site of infection in sufficient numbers and for initiating adaptive immunity. Unresolved inflammation, however, can cause serious damage to host tissues and indeed is known to contribute to the pathology of many acute and chronic diseases. Leukocytes activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) respond, in part, by secreting tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and by shedding the TNF receptor, the latter process occurring with slower kinetics. We suggest that this pro/anti-inflammatory switch is a simple program that helps ensure the resolution of inflammation. To examine this idea, we have developed a microsimulation model in which individual leukocytes with non-trivial internal dynamics move in three-dimensional tissues and interact with each other and with stromal cells through diffusing soluble factors, including TNF, the soluble form of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (sTNFR), and the chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1. By manipulating parameters in numerical experiments with soluble PAMP stimulation of varying intensity and duration, we elicit qualitatively distinct patterns of innate immune response and elucidate a key relationship between leukocyte density enhancement by chemotaxis and paracrine TNF signaling. By reducing the rate of sTNFR shedding, we induce massive unresolved inflammation, underscoring a potentially crucial role of sTNFR in controlling innate immunity.},

The aims of this proof-of-concept study were to determine whether an experimentally induced influenza infection is transmissible between humans and whether this would form a viable platform for future studies. Methods. In a quarantine facility, healthy volunteers (''donors'') were inoculated with A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2) influenza virus via intranasal drops. On study days 2 and 3 ''recipient'' volunteers were exposed to donors under close living conditions. Volunteers socialized for 30 hours during a 2-day period. Infection was confirmed by >= 1 positive results from polymerase chain reaction, virus culture, or serology. Results. After inoculation, 4 of 9 donors developed symptoms consistent an influenza-like illness (ILI) and 7 of 9 were proven to be influenza-infected. After exposure, 4 of 15 recipients developed symptoms of ILI and 3 of 15 were proven to be infected. Serum collected within 2 days of study initiation indicated that 1 donor and 3 recipients were seropositive at study initiation. After adjustment for preexposure immunity, the overall secondary attack rate was 25\% (3 of 12). Conclusions. Experimental human exposure studies offer an attractive potential method for answering outstanding questions related to influenza transmission and the evaluation of interventions to reduce it.},

These difference equations describe the time-evolution of clusters of individual agents that are grouped by discretizing the state space. Hence, unlike standard agent-base models, the complexity of our model is independent of the number of agents, which allows to conduct simulation studies with a realistic number of cells. This approach also allows to directly evaluate the expected steady states of the system. The results of our numerical simulations show that our model replicates the averaged behavior of the original Roeder model with a significantly reduced computational cost. Our general approach can be used to simplify other similar agent-based models. In particular, due to the reduced computational complexity of our technique, one can use it to conduct sensitivity studies of the parameters in large agent-based systems.},

AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO STUDENTS, STAFF AND FACULTY OF McMASTER UNIVERSITY

I am writing on behalf of the Medical Officer of Health of the City of
Hamilton to inform you that a person attending classes at McMaster on
March 6,7and 8, 2001 has been diagnosed with red measles (rubeola). If you
were on campus during these dates you may have been exposed.  
Immunization clinics will be offered this week to those who are not immune
to measles.

Measles is a highly infectious disease with the following symptoms:
· High fever
· Cold-like symptoms, cough, runny nose
· Small spots with a white centre on the inside of the mouth
· Sore eyes, sensitivity to light
· Red rash lasting 4 to seven days.

If you develop any of these symptoms on or before March 26, 2001,
telephone your doctor or Student Health Services immediately. DO NOT GO
DIRECTLY INTO YOUR DOCTOR'S OFFICE OR STUDENT HEALTH without first telling
them that you may have been in contact with someone diagnosed with
measles.  If you need to seek medical attention please take this letter
with you. If you develop measles you must not return to work, school or
day care until 4 days after the appearance of the rash to prevent others
from catching it.

Immunization with MMR at this time will not prevent you from developing
measles due to exposure with this case. However, to protect you from any
further cases, we are advising all students, staff and faculty who are not
immune (see next paragraph) to see their family physician by the end of
this week or to attend the free measles immunization clinic being offered.
Information on this clinic is provided later.

Individuals born before 1957 or with at least one documented dose of
vaccine for measles or diagnosed with measles by a physician are
considered to be immune.  Two doses of measles vaccine are required for
all school children in Ontario.  In 1996 a second dose of this vaccine was
introduced to increase levels of protection for children and teens. If you
were in school in Ontario at this time and received this vaccine you are
protected.  Adults born after 1956 should have one dose of measles
vaccine.  Please check your records (or with your doctor) for proof of
immunization with measles vaccine or proof that you have had measles
infection in the past.  If you require further immunization, please take
this letter to your doctor or to the measles vaccination clinics to
receive the vaccine.

Pregnant women or those planning pregnancy within the next three months
should consult their doctors since the MMR vaccine contains rubella
(German Measles) vaccine which can be harmful to the fetus.

Physicians:  please do not wait for lab confirmation to report a suspected
case of measles in this patient.

To report a suspect case or if you have any further questions, please call
the Communicable Disease Control Branch at (905) 546-2063, 8:30 a.m.- 4:30
p.m., Monday to Friday.  After hours, weekends and holidays please call
(905) 546-3500 and ask for the Public Health Nurse on-call.

   Journal = {Nature},
   Volume = {454},
   Number = {7206},
   Pages = {877-879},
   Abstract = {In many infectious diseases, an unknown fraction of infections produce symptoms mild enough to go unrecorded, a fact that can seriously compromise the interpretation of epidemiological records. This is true for cholera, a pandemic bacterial disease, where estimates of the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections have ranged from 3 to 100 (refs 1-5). In the absence of direct evidence, understanding of fundamental aspects of cholera transmission, immunology and control has been based on assumptions about this ratio and about the immunological consequences of inapparent infections. Here we show that a model incorporating high asymptomatic ratio and rapidly waning immunity, with infection both from human and environmental sources, explains 50 yr of mortality data from 26 districts of Bengal, the pathogen's endemic home. We find that the asymptomatic ratio in cholera is far higher than had been previously supposed and that the immunity derived from mild infections wanes much more rapidly than earlier analyses have indicated. We find, too, that the environmental reservoir(5,6) (free-living pathogen) is directly responsible for relatively few infections but that it may be critical to the disease's endemicity. Our results demonstrate that inapparent infections can hold the key to interpreting the patterns of disease outbreaks. New statistical methods(7), which allow rigorous maximum likelihood inference based on dynamical models incorporating multiple sources and outcomes of infection, seasonality, process noise, hidden variables and measurement error, make it possible to test more precise hypotheses and obtain unexpected results. Our experience suggests that the confrontation of time-series data with mechanistic models is likely to revise our understanding of the ecology of many infectious diseases.},

   Title = {Evolution of acute infections and the invasion persistance trade-off},
   Journal = {The American Naturalist},
   Volume = {173},
   Pages = {446-455},
   Abstract = {We seek to understand the conditions favoring the evolution
of acute, highly transmissible infections. Most work on the
life-history evolution of pathogens has focused on the transmissionvirulence
trade-off. Here we focus on a distinct trade-off that operates,
even among avirulent pathogens, between a pathogen’s speed
of invasion and its ability to persist in a finite host population. Other
authors have shown how this invasion-persistence trade-off can lead
to intermediate pathogen attack rates but have done so only by
imposing trade-offs between the pathogen’s transmissibility and the
duration of the infectious period. Here we delve deeper, by linking
a model of within-host pathogen dynamics—in which pathogen lifehistory
parameters figure directly—to an epidemiological model at
the population level. We find that a key determinant of the evolutionary
trajectory is the shape of the dose-response curve that relates
within-host pathogen load to between-host transmission. In particular,
under the usual assumption of proportionality we find that
pathogens tend to evolve to the edge of their own extinction. Under
more realistic assumptions, a critical host population size exists,
above which highly acute pathogens are buffered from extinction.
Our study is motivated by the emergence of acuteness in two human
pathogens, Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis, which independently
evolved from an ancestor, Bordetella bronchiseptica, characterized
by chronic (nonacute) infection of wildlife. In contrast to
the plethora of models that predict evolution of more aggressive
pathogens in larger or denser populations, the invasion-persistence
trade-off also operates for frequency-dependent pathogens.},

   Abstract = {A number of lines of evidence suggest that immunotherapy with the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) may boost the immune system to fight tumors. CD4+ T cells, the cells that orchestrate the immune response, use these cytokines as signaling mechanisms for immune-response stimulation as well as lymphocyte stimulation, growth, and differentiation. Because tumor cells begin as ‘self’, the immune system may not respond in an effective way to eradicate them. Adoptive cellular immunotherapy can potentially restore or enhance these effects. We illustrate through mathematical modeling the dynamics between tumor cells, immune-effector cells, and IL-2. These efforts are able to explain both short tumor oscillations in tumor sizes as well as long-term tumor relapse. We then explore the effects of adoptive cellular immunotherapy on the model and describe under what circumstances the tumor can be eliminated.},

   Journal = {Brain Research Reviews},
   Volume = {29},
   Number = {2-3},
   Pages = {169-195},
   Abstract = {Evidence is presented that EEG oscillations in the alpha and theta band reflect cognitive and memory performance in particular. Good performance is related to two types of EEG phenomena (i) a tonic increase in alpha but a decrease in theta power, and (ii) a large phasic (event-related) decrease in alpha but increase in theta, depending on the type of memory demands. Because alpha frequency shows large interindividual differences which are related to age and memory performance, this double dissociation between alpha vs. theta and tonic vs. phasic changes can be observed only if fixed frequency bands are abandoned. It is suggested to adjust the frequency windows of alpha and theta for each subject by using individual alpha frequency as an anchor point. Based on this procedure, a consistent interpretation of a variety of findings is made possible. As an example, in a similar way as brain volume does, upper alpha power increases (but theta power decreases) from early childhood to adulthood, whereas the opposite holds true for the late part of the lifespan. Alpha power is lowered and theta power enhanced in subjects with a variety of different neurological disorders. Furthermore, after sustained wakefulness and during the transition from waking to sleeping when the ability to respond to external stimuli ceases, upper alpha power decreases, whereas theta increases. Event-related changes indicate that the extent of upper alpha desynchronization is positively correlated with (semantic) long-term memory performance, whereas theta synchronization is positively correlated with the ability to encode new information. The reviewed findings are interpreted on the basis of brain oscillations. It is suggested that the encoding of new information is reflected by theta oscillations in hippocampo- cortical feedback loops, whereas search and retrieval processes in (semantic) long-term memory are reflected by upper alpha oscillations in thalamo-cortical feedback loops.

Furthermore, most infections are not life-threatening and subtle changes in morbidity are not easily detected.},

   Pages = {703-707},
   Abstract = {The 'Spanish' influenza pandemic of 1918-19 was the most devastating outbreak of infectious disease in recorded history. At least 20 million people died from their illness, which was characterized by an unusually severe and rapid clinical course. The complete sequencing of several genes of the 1918 influenza virus has made it possible to study the functions of the proteins encoded by these genes in viruses generated by reverse genetics, a technique that permits the generation of infectious viruses entirely from cloned complementary DNA. Thus, to identify properties of the 1918 pandemic influenza A strain that might be related to its extraordinary virulence, viruses were produced containing the viral haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of the 1918 strain. The HA of this strain supports the pathogenicity of a mouse-adapted virus in this animal. Here we demonstrate that the HA of the 1918 virus confers enhanced pathogenicity in mice to recent human viruses that !  are otherwise non-pathogenic in this host. Moreover, these highly virulent recombinant viruses expressing the 1918 viral HA could infect the entire lung and induce high levels of macrophage-derived chemokines and cytokines, which resulted in infiltration of inflammatory cells and severe haemorrhage, hallmarks of the illness produced during the original pandemic.},

   Abstract = {Realistic population models have interactions between individuals. Such interactions cause populations to behave as systems with nonlinear dynamics. Much population data analysis is done using linear models assuming no interactions between individuals. Such analyses miss strong influences on population behavior and can lead to serious errors--especially for infectious diseases. To promote more effective population system analyses, we present a flexible and intuitive modeling framework for infection transmission systems. This framework will help population scientists gain insight into population dynamics, develop theory about population processes, better analyze and interpret population data, design more powerful and informative studies, and better inform policy decisions. Our framework uses a hierarchy of infection transmission system models. Four levels are presented here: deterministic compartmental models using ordinary differential equations (DE); stochastic compartmental (SC) models that relax assumptions about population size and include stochastic effects; individual event history models (IEH) that relax the SC compartmental structure assumptions by allowing each individual to be unique. IEH models also track each individual's history, and thus, allow the simulation of field studies. Finally, dynamic network (DNW) models relax the assumption of the previous models that contacts between individuals are instantaneous events that do not affect subsequent contacts. Eventually it should be possible to transit between these model forms at the click of a mouse. An example is presented dealing with Cryptosporidium. It illustrates how transiting model forms helps assess water contamination effects, evaluate control options, and design studies of infection transmission systems using nucleotide sequences of infectious agents.},

   School = {McMaster University, Canada},
   Type = {{PhD}},
   Abstract = {Mathematical modelling has become a powerful tool used to predict the spread of infectious diseases in populations. Successful analysis and modeling of historical infectious disease data can explain changes in the pattern of past epidemics and lead to a better understanding of epidemiological processes. The lessons learned can be used to predict future epidemics and help to improve public healthstrategies for control and eradication.
This thesis is focused on the analysis and modelling of smallpox dynamics based on the weekly smallpox mortality records in London, England, 1664--1930. Statistical analysis of these records is presented. A timeline of significant historical events related to changes in variolation and vaccination uptake levels and demographics was established. These events were correlated with transitions observed in smallpox dynamics. Seasonality of the smallpox time series was investigated and the contact rate between susceptible and infectious individuals was found to be seasonally forced. Seasonal variations in smallpox transmission and changes in their seasonality over long time scale were estimated. The method of transition analysis, which is used to predict qualitative changes in epidemiological patterns, was used to explain the transitions observed in the smallpox time series. We found that the standard SIR model exhibits dynamics similar to the more realistic Gamma distributed SEIR model if the mean serial interval is chosen the same, so we used the standard SIR model for our analysis. We conclude that transitions observed in the temporal pattern of smallpox dynamics can be explained by the changes in birth, immigration and intervention uptake levels.},

   Abstract = {BACKGROUND A worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been associated with exposures originating from a single ill health care worker from Guangdong Province, China. We conducted studies to identify the etiologic agent of this outbreak. METHODS We received clinical specimens from patients in seven countries and tested them, using virus- isolation techniques, electron-microscopical and histologic studies, and molecular and serologic assays, in an attempt to identify a wide range of potential pathogens. RESULTS None of the previously described respiratory pathogens were consistently identified. However, a novel coronavirus was isolated from patients who met the case definition of SARS. Cytopathological features were noted in Vero E6 cells inoculated with a throat-swab specimen. Electron-microscopical examination revealed ultrastructural features characteristic of coronaviruses. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining revealed reactivity with group I coronavirus polyclonal antibodies. Consensus coronavirus primers designed to amplify a fragment of the polymerase gene by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to obtain a sequence that clearly identified the isolate as a unique coronavirus only distantly related to previously sequenced coronaviruses. With specific diagnostic RT-PCR primers we identified several identical nucleotide sequences in 12 patients from several locations, a finding consistent with a point-source outbreak. Indirect fluorescence antibody tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays made with the new isolate have been used to demonstrate a virus-specific serologic response. This virus may never before have circulated in the U.S. population. CONCLUSIONS A novel coronavirus is associated with this outbreak, and the evidence indicates that this virus has an etiologic role in SARS. Because of the death of Dr. Carlo Urbani, we propose that our first isolate be named the Urbani strain of SARS-associated coronavirus.},

   Abstract = {DNA was extracted from an 11 700-year-old rodent midden from the Atacama Desert, Chile and the chloroplast and animal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene sequences were analysed to investigate the floral environment surrounding the midden, and the identity of the midden agent. The plant sequences, together with the macroscopic identifications, suggest the presence of 13 plant families and three orders that no longer exist today at the midden locality, and thus point to a much more diverse and humid climate 11 700 years ago. The mtDNA sequences suggest the presence of at least four different vertebrates, which have been putatively identified as a camelid (vicuna), two rodents (Phyllotis and Abrocoma ), and a cardinal bird (Passeriformes). To identify the midden agent, DNA was extracted from pooled faecal pellets, three small overlapping fragments of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene were ampli-fied and multiple clones were sequenced. These results were analysed along with com-plete cytochrome b sequences for several modern Phyllotis species to place the midden sequence phylogenetically. The results identified the midden agent as belonging to an ancestral P. limatus. Today, P. limatus is not found at the midden locality but it can be found 100 km to the north, indicating at least a small range shift. The more extensive sampling of modern Phyllotis reinforces the suggestion that P. limatus is recently derived from a peripheral isolate.},

IFN-treated animals developed only mild and transient respiratory symptoms, and the characteristic fever peak seen in mock-treated ferrets 2 days after infection was not observed. Repeated application of IFN-alpha substantially increased the protective effect of the cytokine treatment. IFN-alpha did not increase survival after infection with the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza A virus strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004. However, viral titers in nasal washes were significantly reduced at days 1 and 3 postinfection. Our study shows that intranasal application of IFN-alpha can protect ferrets from seasonal influenza viruses, which replicate mainly in the upper respiratory tract, but not from highly pathogenic influenza viruses, which also disseminate to the lung. Based on these results, a more intensive evaluation of IFN-alpha as an emergency drug against pandemic influenza A is warranted.},

   Abstract = {To a good first approximation the Galaxy is stationary and axisymmetric.  However, many disk galaxies exhibit prominent large-scale deviations from axisymmetry, such as bars, warps, ``grand design'' spiral structure, elliptical distortions of the bulge and disk, and lopsided H\I\ distributions.  In addition, models of galaxy formation strongly suggest that the dark matter halos of galaxies are likely to be triaxial, and the potential from these components will inevitably distort the disk.  Thus it is natural to look for evidence of large-scale oscillations (i.e., non-axisymmetric distortions or axisymmetric time-dependent distortions) of the Galactic disk.  Because of our location within the Galaxy, the large-scale kinematic models that we deduce for the Galaxy depend strongly on our interpretation of the small-scale kinematics of the solar neighbourhood.  For example, asymmetry of the northern and southern H\I\ distributions in velocity-longitude space could be caused by either a distortion of the outer Galaxy or radial motion of the Local Standard of Rest.  We shall review the evidence for oscillations of the Galatic disk, with particular emphasis on the interplay between these oscillations and the kinematics of the solar neighbourhood.},

The relevant torques are calculated in their full nonlinearity, extending the results of linear-mode calculations.  It is shown that for two specific examples, NGC 2841 and M33, it is possible to reproduce closely the observed warp shapes with these models.  It is further demonstrated that the observed shapes of a galaxy's warp and rotation curve do not suffice to determine the disk mass uniquely, but can only provide upper limits on the disk-to-halo mass ratio.  In the case of M33, this limit is about one-third of a maximal disk decomposition of the rotation curve.
Qualitative differences between the linear theory and the present work are discussed.},

   Abstract = {Background The ability to detect disease outbreaks early is important in order to minimize morbidity and mortality through timely implementation of disease prevention and control measures. Many national, state, and local health departments are launching disease surveillance systems with daily analyses of hospital emergency department visits, ambulance dispatch calls, or pharmacy sales for which population-at-risk information is unavailable or irrelevant.
Methods and Findings We propose a prospective space-time permutation scan statistic for the early detection of disease outbreaks that uses only case numbers, with no need for population-at-risk data. It makes minimal assumptions about the time, geographical location, or size of the outbreak, and it adjusts for natural purely spatial and purely temporal variation. The new method was evaluated using daily analyses of hospital emergency department visits in New York City. Four of the five strongest signals were likely local precursors to citywide outbreaks due to rotavirus, norovirus, and influenza. The number of false signals was at most modest.
Conclusion If such results hold up over longer study times and in other locations, the space-time permutation scan statistic will be an important tool for local and national health departments that are setting up early disease detection surveillance systems.},

   Abstract = {Backcalculation is a methodology to reconstruct the past human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection rates from the AIDS incidence data and incubation distribution by deconvolution. Smoothing has proved important in backcalculation, and a key question is how to choose the amount of smoothing. This paper proposes an empirical Bayes approach in which the smoothing parameter is estimated from the data. We introduce a family of priors that reflect the notion of closeness of neighboring infection rates. The variance parameter in the prior family plays the role of the smoothing parameter and is estimated by a method similar to the residual maximum likelihood in linear random effects model through an efficient EM (expectation/maximization) algorithm. A number of penalized likelihood functions that have been used in backcalculation have an empirical Bayes formulation. A bootstrap confidence interval for the infection rates is proposed. The methodology is illustrated with United States AIDS incidence data.},

This perspective is, however, more easily achieved in the case of fertility than of mortality, which is widely treated as a variable `exogenous' to economy and society. In the present paper it is argued that the inclusion of spatial structure and migration in accounts of historical demographic regimes can restore long-term variations in mortality to an `endogenous' position. Within such a model a central role is played by large metropolitan populations, which act as endemic reservoirs of infection, with high but relatively stable levels of mortality. Data from the annual London Bills of Mortality allow empirical testing for the period 1675-1825, with results which generally conform to theoretical expectations, although a substantial reduction in mortality occurs during the latter part of the period.},

   Number = {3},
   Pages = {271-281},
   Abstract = {A stochastic model is developed to analyze the equilibrium spatial pattern of population synchrony, the correlation of temporal fluctuations in population density between localities. The expected population dynamics and the distribution of individual dispersal distance are homogeneous in space. Environmental stochasticity is caused by temporal fluctuations in the intrinsic rate of increase and/or carrying capacity of local populations that are correlated in space (but not time), the environmental correlation decreasing with distance. We analyze a linearized model for small fluctuations. Employing the standard deviation of a function in a given direction as a measure of scale, the spatial scale of population synchrony, l(rho), is related to the spatial scales of environmental correlation, l(r), and individual dispersal, l, by the simple general formula l(rho)(2) = l(e)(2) + ml(2)/gamma, where m is the individual dispersal rate and gamma is the strength of population density regulation (or rate of return to equilibrium, (r) over bar in the logistic model). Relative to environmental correlation (the Moran effect), the contribution of individual dispersal to the spatial scale of synchrony is magnified by the ratio of the individual dispersal rate to the strength of density regulation. Thus, even if the scale of individual dispersal is smaller than that of environmental correlation, dispersal can substantially increase the scale of population synchrony for weakly regulated populations.},

   Number = {10},
   Pages = {1213-1222},
   Abstract = {Background: Although all jurisdictions in Canada offer annual influenza immunization to people at high risk of complications, only Ontario has provided universal annual immunization of healthy adults and children. Use of chemotherapy (amantidine, neuraminidase inhibitors) to prevent influenza varies among provinces. We sought to systematically review the evidence for the prevention of influenza infection in the general population. Methods: The interventions reviewed were influenza vaccination and prophylactic use of neuraminidase inhibitors. The health outcomes of interest were rates of laboratory- confirmed influenza infection, clinical definitions of influenza-like illness and work absenteeism. MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant articles published between 1966 and March 2003. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were selected. Evidence was appraised using the methodology of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. Results: Eighteen trials involving more than 33 000 healthy adults were identified that met the inclusion criteria; of these, 15 showed that influenza vaccination with either live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines was efficacious. Eleven trials were considered to be of "good" quality, and 7 were considered to be of "fair" quality. The relative risk reduction (RRR) associated with influenza immunization in adults ranged from 0% to 91%. Fifteen RCTs involving more than 45 000 healthy children aged 6 months to 19 years were identified, of which 9 were considered to contain "good" evidence and 6 "fair" evidence. Results from 12 of these trials showed protection against influenza. The RRR ranged from 0% to 93%. There were 6 RCTs of "good" quality showing that neuraminidase inhibitors are effective in preventing influenza infection. Side effects from both influenza vaccination and neuraminidase inhibitor administration were mild. Interpretation: There are numerous RCTs of good quality in large populations that have consistently shown that influenza vaccination, using inactivated or live-attenuated vaccines, is moderately effective in preventing influenza in the general population (healthy adults and children over 6 months of age). There is good evidence that neuraminidase inhibitor prophylaxis in contacts given within 36 to 48 hours of symptom onset of the household index case is effective; appropriate use of this prevention method requires access to rapid diagnostic methods. Decisions about introduction of routine immunization programs must take into account the cost and cost-effectiveness of a universal program and the burden of illness associated with influenza in each jurisdiction.},

   Journal = {Journal of Theoretical Biology},
   Volume = {212},
   Number = {1},
   Pages = {57-69},
   Abstract = {Shape space was proposed over 20 years ago as a conceptual formalism in which to represent antibody/antigen binding. It has since played a key role in computational immunology. Antigens and antibodies are considered to be points in an abstract "shape space", where coordinates of points in this space represent generalized physico-chemical properties associated with various (unspecified) physical properties related to binding, such as geometric shape, hydrophobicity, charge, etc. Distances in shape space between points representing antibodies and (the shape complement) of antigens are assumed to be related to their affinity, with small distances corresponding to high affinity. In this paper, we provide algorithms, related to metric and ordinal multidimensional scaling algorithms first developed in the mathematical psychology literature, which construct explicit, quantitative coordinates for points in shape space given experimental data such as hemagglutination inhibition assays, or other general affinity assays. Previously, such coordinates had been conceptual constructs and totally implicit. The dimension of shape space deduced from hemagglutination inhibition assays for influenza is low, approximately five dimensional. The deduction of the explicit geometry of shape space given experimental affinity data provides new ways to quantify the similarity of antibodies to antibodies, antigens to antigens, and the affinity of antigens to antibodies. This has potential utility in, e.g. strain selection decisions for annual influenza vaccines, among other applications. The analysis techniques presented here are not restricted to the analysis of antibody-antigen interactions and are generally applicable to affinity data resulting from binding assays.

The household and household member attack rates were calculated for 1,214 SARS case-patients and their household members, stratified by two phases of the epidemic. A case-control analysis identified risk factors for secondary infection. Secondary infection occurred in 14.9% (22.1% versus 11% in earlier and later phases) of all households and 8% (11.7% versus 5.9% in the earlier and later phases) of all household members. Healthcare workers' households were less likely to be affected. Risk factors from the multivariate analysis included at-home duration before hospitalization, hospital visitation to the SARS patient (and mask use during the visit), and frequency of close contact. SARS transmission at the household level was not negligible in Hong Kong. Transmission rates may be greatly reduced with precautionary measures taken by household members of SARS patients.},

   Abstract = {A huge, worldwide epidemic (pandemic) of influenza could occur at any time. This will be caused by a
       “new” virus to which the human population has no immunity and which will probably arise somewhere in
       China. The Meeting at the Royal Society on April 25 \& 26, 2001 discussed ways in which this new influenza
       virus might emerge and how it might be controlled. Vaccines against the new virus would take some time to
       prepare, and therefore the first line of defence might be the new flu drugs that stop the virus from
       replicating by inhibiting an enzyme (neuraminidase) which the virus needs to spread in the body. Four of
       these drugs have been developed and these seem to be effective provided they are given early after
       infection and, of course, if they are used to treat only influenza and not other viral or bacterial infections
       for which they are useless. Evidence is accumulating which suggests that the new virus might have trouble
       developing resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitors, but it is also obvious that in the event of a
       pandemic, supplies of these drugs will be woefully inadequate, with millions of sick people and probably
       many deaths from flu worldwide. Thus the new pandemic might present more social or political problems
       than scientific ones.},

Duration of immunity and epidemically significant routes of transmission across age groups remain unclear and deserve further investigation to inform vaccination strategies to better control pertussis burden. The authors analyze age- and species- specific whooping cough tests and vaccine histories in Massachusetts from 1990 to 2008. On average, the disease-free duration is 10.5 years. However, it has been decreasing over time, possibly due to a rising force of infection through increased circulation. Despite the importance of teenage cases during epi- demics, wavelet analyses suggest that they are not the most important source of transmission to infants. In addition, the data indicate that the B. pertussis vaccine is not protective against disease induced by B. parapertussis.},

   Abstract = {Incidence of whooping cough, unlike many other childhood diseases for which there is an efficacious vaccine, has been increasing over the past twenty years despite high levels of vaccine coverage. Its reemergence has been particularly noticeable among teenagers and adults. Many hypotheses have been put forward to explain these two patterns, but parsimonious reconciliation of clinical data on the limited duration of immunity with both pre- and postvaccine era age-specific incidence remains a challenge. We consider the immunologically relevant, yet epidemiologically largely neglected, possibility that a primed immune system can respond to a lower dose of antigen than a naive one. We hypothesize that during the prevaccine era teenagers’ and adults’ primed immunity was frequently boosted by reexposure, so maintaining herd immunity in the face of potentially eroding individual immunity. In contrast, low pathogen circulation in the current era, except during epidemic outbreaks, allows immunity to be lost before reexposure occurs. We develop and analyze an age-structured model that encapsulates this hypothesis. We find that immune boosting must be more easily triggered than primary infection to account for age-incidence data. We make age-specific and dynamical predictions through bifurcation analysis and simulation. The boosting model proposed here parsimoniously captures four key features of pertussis data from highly vaccinated countries: (i) the shift in age-specific incidence, (ii) reemergence with high vaccine coverage, (iii) the possibility for cyclic dynamics in the pre- and postvaccine eras, and (iv) the apparent shift from susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR)-like to susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible (SIRS)-like phenomenology of infection and immunity to Bordetella pertussis.},

   Abstract = {BACKGROUND There has been an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) worldwide. We report the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features of 138 cases of suspected SARS during a hospital outbreak in Hong Kong. METHODS From March 11 to 25, 2003, all patients with suspected SARS after exposure to an index patient or ward were admitted to the isolation wards of the Prince of Wales Hospital. Their demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics were analyzed. Clinical end points included the need for intensive care and death. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS There were 66 male patients and 72 female patients in this cohort, 69 of whom were health care workers. The most common symptoms included fever (in 100 percent of the patients); chills, rigors, or both (73.2 percent); and myalgia (60.9 percent). Cough and headache were also reported in more than 50 percent of the patients. Other common findings were lymphopenia (in 69.6 percent), thrombocytopenia (44.8 percent), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase levels (71.0 percent and 32.1 percent, respectively). Peripheral air-space consolidation was commonly observed on thoracic computed tomographic scanning. A total of 32 patients (23.2 percent) were admitted to the intensive care unit; 5 patients died, all of whom had coexisting conditions. In a multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of an adverse outcome were advanced age (odds ratio per decade of life, 1.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.16 to 2.81; P=0.009), a high peak lactate dehydrogenase level (odds ratio per 100 U per liter, 2.09; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.28 to 3.42; P=0.003), and an absolute neutrophil count that exceeded the upper limit of the normal range on presentation (odds ratio, 1.60; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.03 to 2.50; P=0.04).

   Abstract = {We used a deterministic SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) meta-population model, together with scenario, sensitivity, and simulation analyses, to determine stockpiling strategies for neuraminidase inhibitors that would minimize absenteeism among healthcare workers. A pandemic with a basic reproductive number (R-0) of 2.5 resulted in peak absenteeism of 10%. Treatment decreased peak absenteeism to 8%, while 8 weeks' prophylaxis reduced it to 2%. For pandemics with higher R-0, peak absenteeism exceeded 20% occasionally and 6 weeks' prophylaxis reduced peak absenteeism by 75%. Insufficient duration of prophylaxis increased peak absenteeism compared with treatment only. Earlier pandemic detection and initiation of prophylaxis may render shorter prophylaxis durations ineffective. Eight weeks' prophylaxis substantially reduced peak absenteeism under a broad range of assumptions for severe pandemics (peak absenteeism > 10%). Small investments in treatment and prophylaxis, if adequate and timely, can reduce absenteeism among essential staff.},

For example, there is no single wavelength that appears white. Many models of decoding neural population codes have problems handling multiple inputs, either attempting to extract a single value of the input parameter or, in some cases, registering the presence of multiple inputs without synthesizing them into something new. These examples raise a more general issue regarding the interpretation of population codes. We propose that population decoding involves not the extraction of specific values of the physical inputs, but rather a transformation from the input space to some abstract representational space that is not simply related to physical parameters. As a specific example, a four-layer network is presented that implements a transformation from wavelength to a high-level hue-saturation color space.},

We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

   Abstract = {A stochastic discrete-time susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model for infectious diseases is developed with the aim of estimating parameters from daily incidence and mortality time series for an outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1995. The incidence time series exhibit many low integers as well as zero counts requiring an intrinsically stochastic modeling approach. In order to capture the stochastic nature of the transitions between the compartmental populations in such a model we specify appropriate conditional binomial distributions. In addition, a relatively simple temporally varying transmission rate function is introduced that allows for the effect of control interventions. We develop Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for inference that are used to explore the posterior distribution of the parameters. The algorithm is further extended to integrate numerically over state variables of the model, which are unobserved. This provides a realistic stochastic model that can be used by epidemiologists to study the dynamics of the disease and the effect of control interventions.},

   Journal = {New England Journal of Medicine},
   Volume = {361},
   Number = {27},
   Pages = {2628-2636},
   Abstract = {Background
In April 2009, an outbreak of novel swine-origin influenza A (2009 H1N1 influenza) occurred at a high school in Queens, New York. We describe the outbreak and characterize the clinical and epidemiologic aspects of this novel virus.
Methods
The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene characterized the out- break through laboratory confirmation of the presence of the 2009 H1N1 virus in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens and through information obtained from an online survey. Detailed information on exposure and the onset of symptoms was used to estimate the incubation period, generation time, and within-school reproductive number associated with 2009 H1N1 influenza, with the use of established techniques.
Results
From April 24 through May 8, infection with the 2009 H1N1 virus was confirmed in 124 high-school students and employees. In responses to the online questionnaire, more than 800 students and employees (35\% of student respondents and 10\% of employee respondents) reported having an influenza-like illness during this period. No persons with confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza or with influenza-like illness had severe symptoms. A linkage with travel to Mexico was identified. The estimated median incubation period for confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza was 1.4 days (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 1.8), with symptoms developing in 95\% of cases by 2.2 days (95\% CI, 1.7 to 2.6). The estimated median generation time was 2.7 days (95\% CI, 2.0 to 3.5). We estimate that the within-school reproductive number was 3.3.
Conclusions
The findings from this investigation suggest that 2009 H1N1 influenza in the high school was widespread but did not cause severe illness. The reasons for the rapid and extensive spread of influenza-like illnesses are unknown. The natural history and transmission of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus appear to be similar to those of previously observed circulating pandemic and interpandemic influenza viruses.},

   Journal = {Journal of theoretical biology},
   Volume = {190},
   Number = {2},
   Pages = {161-178},
   Abstract = {Autoimmune diseases are thought to occur through some weakness in an active process of autoregulation. Two diﬀerent regulatory mechanisms have been proposed separately during the years: a ‘‘non-speciﬁc’’ mechanism, via Th1-Th2 non-speciﬁc cytokines, and a ‘‘speciﬁc’’ one-on-one mechanism, via presentation of peptides, i.e., T cell receptor (TCR) peptides, by the T cells themselves. Several anti-idiotypic models rely on the latter to explain the eﬀects of ‘‘T-cell-vaccination’’ therapy. We present and analyse a model for the interaction between both regulatory mechanisms within an ensemble composed of Th1 and Th2 cells. Our model shows how both TCR presentation and non-speciﬁc Th1/2 signals can cooperate in the choice of the prevailing Th1 or Th2 response. We show how TCR 
presentation can foster regulation, without necessitating a particular ‘‘suppressor’’ agent, of the type that some have assumed to play a central role in the regulation of autoimmunity. Our results suggest an important role for the cells’ sensitivities to Th1 and Th2 derived cytokines; only for certain sensitivity ranges, is it possible to switch dominance between subtypes. It is argued that memory is sustained via modulation of sensitivities to cytokines, not only to antigens. The results and hypotheses also suggest one possible reason for the known correlation between standard and autoimmune diseases. Several therapies and informative experiments are suggested. We argue, for example, that administering a non-relevant peptide while increasing the ratio between the clones reactive to it and other clones in the 
pancreas, might cure autoimmune diabetes. Moreover, we predict that disease could be prevented by administering an autoimmune peptide at an early age while forcing the system to react in a Th2 fashion.},

In open communities, it will take years or even decades to see substantial reductions in the frequency of antibiotic resistance solely as a result of more prudent (reduced) use of antibiotics. However, if we can restrict the input of resistant bacteria into hospitals, through the application of infection control and other measures, it should be possible to reduce the frequency of resistance and even eliminate resistant bacteria from these institutions in short order.},

   Pages = {985-997},
   Abstract = {In the absence of the selecting drugs, chromosomal mutations for resistance to antibiotics and other chemotheraputic agents commonly engender a cost ill the fitness of microorganisms. Recent in vivo and in vitro experimental studies of the adaptation to these "costs of resistance" in Escherichia coli, HIV, and Salmonella typhimurium found that evolution in the absence of these drugs commonly results in the ascent of mutations that ameliorate these costs, rather than higher- fitness, drug-sensitive revertants. To ascertain the conditions under which this compensatory evolution, rather than reversion, will occur, we did computer simulations, in vitro, experiments, and DNA sequencing studies with low-fitness rpsL (streptomycin- resistant) mutants of E, coli with and without mutations that compensate for the fitness costs of these ribosomal protein mutations. The results of our investigation support,rt the hypothesis that in these experiments, the ascent of intermediate-fitness compensatory mutants, rather than high- fitness revertants, can be attributed to higher rates of compensatory mutations relative to that of reversion and to the numerical bottlenecks associated with serial passage. We argue that these bottlenecks are intrinsic to the population dynamics of parasitic and commensal microbes and discuss the implications of these results to the problem of drug resistance and adaptive evolution in parasitic and commmensal microorganisms in general.},

The purpose of this book is to provide a forum for researches with different backgrounds and expertise and to ensure further advances in the study of dispersal and spatial ecology. This book is unique in its attempt to give an overview of dispersal studies across different spatial scales, such as the scale of individual movement, the population scale and the scale of communities and ecosystems.

   Abstract = {Background. We used the large clinical database that supported the development of Oka/Merck varicella vaccine to study the relationship between the primary varicella antibody response, as determined by gpELISA, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that detects antibodies to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) glycoprotein, and the subsequent risk of postvaccination breakthrough varicella. Methods. We vaccinated 1164 healthy children with a single dose of varicella vaccine containing 2900 to 9000 plaque-forming units/dose. The primary immune response to vaccination was determined by gpELISA 6 weeks after vaccination. Subjects were followed annually for 7 years to ascertain cases of breakthrough varicella. Results. The estimated vaccine efficacy among children with a 6-week postvaccination antibody titer of greater than or equal to5 gpELISA units was 95.5% (95% confidence interval, 94.2%, 96.8%) compared with 83.5% (95% confidence interval, 76.9%, 89.5%) for subjects with a titer of <5 gpELISA units. Children with a 6- week postvaccination antibody titer of <5 gpELISA units were 3.5 times more likely than those with a titer of greater than or equal to5 gpELISA units to develop breakthrough varicella. Conclusions. We identified a 6-week postvaccination antibody titer of greater than or equal to5 gpELISA units as an approximate correlate of protection. In addition we established an accelerated failure time model based on log normal hazard that predicted varicella breakthrough rates based on the distribution of 6-week postvaccination varicella antibody titers.},

   Abstract = {A highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, H5N1, caused disease outbreaks in poultry in China and seven other east Asian countries between late 2003 and early 2004; the same virus was fatal to humans in Thailand and Vietnam(1). Here we demonstrate a series of genetic reassortment events traceable to the precursor of the H5N1 viruses that caused the initial human outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997 (refs 2-4) and subsequent avian outbreaks in 2001 and 2002 ( refs 5, 6). These events gave rise to a dominant H5N1 genotype (Z) in chickens and ducks that was responsible for the regional outbreak in 2003-04. Our findings indicate that domestic ducks in southern China had a central role in the generation and maintenance of this virus, and that wild birds may have contributed to the increasingly wide spread of the virus in Asia. Our results suggest that H5N1 viruses with pandemic potential have become endemic in the region and are not easily eradicable. These developments pose a threat to public and veterinary health in the region and potentially the world, and suggest that long-term control measures are required.},

Our derived estimates permitted evaluation of relationships between various model-derived and data-based estimations, allowing evaluation of trends proposed previously but not tested fully. As well as providing insights into the dynamics of viral shedding and symptom scores, a more profound understanding of influenza epidemiological parameters and determinants could enhance the viral kinetic studies of influenza during infection in the respiratory tracts of experimentally infected individuals.},

   Volume = {242},
   Pages = {789--798},
   Abstract = {We investigate the validity of the standard assumptions used in calculating the dynamics of a massive black hole in the center of a dense stellar system such as a globular cluster.  First, the motion of the hole due to perturbations from its associated cusp of bound stars is usually neglected.  We find that this assumption introduces substantial errors in the relaxation rate in the cusp; however, these errors are less that the statistical uncertainties due to the small number of cusp stars.  The contribution of cusp star perturbations to the overall Brownian motion of the hole is negligible.  Second, the effects of close encounters between stars are usually neglected.  We confirm that close encounters have only a small effect on the stellar density distribution in the cusp, but we find that ejection by close encounters is the dominant hole-induced source of mass loss from the cluster core: a star entering the cusp is more likely to be ejected from the core than to be swallowed by the hole.  A centrally condensed cluster with a massive hole may lose stars by ejection faster than by evaporation.  Both ejection from the cusp and diffusion into the cusp pump energy into the cluster and slow core collapse.  The diffusive flux alone is not sufficient to halt core collapse before the core disappears within the cusp;  however, a complete understanding of the fate of the core will require numerical calculations which include the effects of ejection as well.  These results show that close encounters play a major role in the evolution of a hole plus cluster system.},

   Journal = {American Journal Of Epidemiology},
   Volume = {154},
   Number = {1},
   Pages = {85-92},
   Abstract = {Conjugate vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) protect against nasopharyngeal carriage of serotypes included in the vaccine. However, in several clinical trials, vaccinees have shown increased carriage of nonvaccine serotypes of pneumococcus. These increases may be due to serotype replacement, if vaccine-induced protection against carriage of vaccine serotypes increases susceptibility to carriage of nonvaccine serotypes. Alternatively, observed increases may be an artifact of "unmasking" in which nonvaccine serotypes are more readily detected among vaccinees than among controls because vaccine serotypes are not present. In this paper, a statistical test for distinguishing serotype replacement from unmasking is described. The test attempts to reject a null model of unmasking alone; serotype replacement is inferred if the observed increase in detectable nonvaccine serotype carriage among vaccinees is significantly greater than that expected under the null model. Significance is assessed using the Bayesian "posterior predictive p value" as modified by Robins et al. (J Am Sfat Assoc 2000;95:1143-56). Analysis of data from a South African trial suggests that replacement may have occurred in the study, but results do not reach the conventional level of significance in rejecting the null hypothesis of unmasking (p = 0.074). The author performs sensitivity analyses for the prior and for unmeasured confounding by differences in susceptibility to pneumococcus carriage. The implications of the findings and the assumptions and limitations of this technique are then discussed.},

Thus inferences from individual risk factors can yield misleading conclusions about the effect of antibiotic use on resistance to another antibiotic. (ii) Nonspecific interventions that reduce transmission of all bacteria within a hospital will disproportionately reduce the prevalence of colonization with resistant bacteria. (iii) Changes in the prevalence of resistance after a successful intervention will occur on a time scale of weeks to months, considerably faster than in community-acquired infections. Moreover, resistance can decline rapidly in a hospital even if it does not carry a fitness cost. The predictions of the model are compared with those of other models and published data.

   Pages = {161--170},
   Abstract = {We investigate the long-term dynamical evolution of barred galaxies using flat, fully self-gravitating, bar-unstable, disc-halo models.  Our models develop rapidly rotating bars which subsequently slow through roughly equal transfers of angular momentum to the outer disc and to the halo.  Once our bars are well formed, their pattern speeds decline approximately linearly with time, and we conclude that even in the absence of visible spiral patterns, a low-amplitude trailing response can continue to slow bars significantly for $\sim10$ Gyr.  Our experiments suggest that a typical bar will slow by a factor of $\sim2$ in a Hubble time.  When our bars first form, they end at or slightly inside corotation ($1.0 \lta r_{\rm cr} / r_{\rm bar} \lta 1.1$), but this distance grows with time and, by the end of our simulations,  $r_{\rm cr} / r_{\rm bar} \gta 1.3$.  Such a ratio agrees well with existing observations, and we provide an approximate formula which expresses this evolution. Our models also suggest that the average tangential velocity within a bar drops by a factor of about 2 over $\sim45$ initial rotation periods.},

   Abstract = {We use a model galaxy with an artificial bar to explore the angular momentum exchange induced by bar-like ($m=2$) perturbations to a disc.  We provide an analytic formula for this exchange which predicts to within $\sim 1$ per cent the interaction between a weak bar and a non-self-gravitating disc.  We also present the results of $N$-body experiments which suggest that the neglect of disc self-gravity in analytic theory leads to: (i)~an underestimate of the slowdown rate of a bar which is dominated by corotation and outer Lindblad resonances;  (ii)~an overestimate of the spin-up rate of a bar which is dominated by inner Lindblad resonances.  Additional simulations suggest that the importance of disc self-gravity is generally enhanced by increasing the age of the bar, but is lessenned by increasing the temperature of the disc.  All these effects have natural explanations, and estimates of their magnitude are provided for several particular cases.},

   Abstract = {DNA computing was proposed(1) as a means of solving a class of intractable computational problems in which the computing time can grow exponentially with problem size (the 'NP-complete' or non-deterministic polynomial time complete problems). The principle of the technique has been demonstrated experimentally for a simple example of the hamiltonian path problem(2) (in this case, finding an airline flight path between several cities, such that each city is visited only once(3)). DNA computational approaches to the solution of other problems have also been investigated(4-9). One technique(10-13) involves the immobilization and manipulation of combinatorial mixtures of DNA on a support. A set of DNA molecules encoding all candidate solutions to the computational problem of interest is synthesized and attached to the surface. Successive cycles of hybridization operations and exonuclease digestion are used to identify and eliminate those members of the set that are not solutions. Upon completion of all the multistep cycles, the solution to the computational problem is identified using a polymerase chain reaction to amplify the remaining molecules, which are then hybridized to an addressed array. The advantages of this approach are its scalability and potential to be automated (the use of solid-phase formats simplifies the complex repetitive chemical processes, as has been demonstrated in DNA and protein synthesis(14)). Here we report the use of this method to solve a NP-complete problem. We consider a small example of the satisfiability problem (SAT)(2), in which the values of a set of boolean variables satisfying certain logical constraints are determined.},

   Journal = {Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B-Biological Sciences},
   Volume = {268},
   Number = {1469},
   Pages = {847-854},
   Abstract = {Estimation of viral parameters, such as the basic reproductive number (R-0) and infected cell life span, is central to the quantitative study of the within-host dynamics of viral diseases such as human immunodeficiency) virus, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. As these parameters can rarely be determined directly, they are usually estimated indirectly by fitting mathematical models to viral load data. This paper investigates how parameter estimates obtained by such procedures depend on tile assumptions made concerning the viral life cycle. It finds that estimates of the basic reproductive e number obtained using viral load data collected during the initial stages of infection can depend quite sensitive on these assumptions. The use of models which neglect the intracellular delay before virion production can lead to set ere underestimates of R-0 and, hence, to overly optimistic predictions of how efficacious treatment must be in order to prevent or eradicate the disease. These results are also of importance for attempts at estimating R-0 from similar epidemiological data as there is a correspondence between within-host and between-host models. Estimates of the life span of infected cells obtained from viral load data collected during drug treatment studies also depend on the assumptions made in modelling the virus life cycle. The use of more realistic descriptions of the life cycle is seen to increase estimates of infected cell life span, in addition to providing a new explanation for the shoulder phase seen during drug treatment. This study highlights the limitations of what can be learnt by fitting mathematical models to infectious disease data T without detailed independent knowledge of the life cycle of the infectious agent.},

   Abstract = {Most mathematical models used to understand the dynamical patterns seen in the incidence of childhood viral diseases, such as measles, employ a simple, but epidemiologically unrealistic, description of the infection and recovery process. The inclusion of more realistic descriptions of the recovery process is shown to cause a significant destabilization of the model. When there is seasonal variation in disease transmission this destabilization leads to the appearance of complex dynamical patterns with much lower levels of seasonality than previously predicted. More generally this study illustrates how detailed dynamical properties of a model may depend in an important way on the assumptions made in the formulation of the model.},

   Abstract = {Most mathematical models used to study the epidemiology of childhood viral diseases, such as measles, describe the period of infectiousness by an exponential distribution. The effects of including more realistic descriptions of the infectious period within SIR (susceptible/infectious/recovered) models are studied. Less dispersed distributions are seen to have two important epidemiological consequences. First, less stable behaviour is seen within the model: incidence patterns become more complex. Second, disease persistence is diminished: in models with a finite population, the minimum population size needed to allow disease persistence increases. The assumption made concerning the infectious period distribution is of a kind routinely made in the formulation of mathematical models in population biology. Since it has a major eff ect on the central issues of population persistence and dynamics, the results of this study have broad implications for mathematical modellers of a wide range of biological systems.

   Abstract = {The major role played by demographic stochasticity in determining the dynamics and persistence of childhood diseases, such as measles, chickenpox and pertussis, has long been realized. Techniques which can be used to estimate the magnitude of this stochastic effect are of clear importance. In this study, we assess and compare the use of two moment closure approximations to estimate the variability seen about the average behavior of stochastic models for the recurrent epidemics seen in childhood diseases. The performance of the approximations are assessed using analytic techniques available for the simplest epidemiological model and using numerical simulations in more complex settings. We also present epidemiologically important extensions of previous work, considering variability in the SEIR model and in situations for which there is seasonal variation in disease transmission. Important implications of stochastic effects for the dynamics of childhood diseases are highlighted, including serious deficiencies of deterministic descriptions of dynamical behavior.

   Journal = {Nature},
   Volume = {438},
   Pages = {355-359},
   Abstract = {Population-level analyses often use average quantities to describe heterogeneous systems, particularly when variation does not arise from identifiable groups1,2. A prominent example, central to our current understanding of epidemic spread, is the basic reproductive number, R0, which is defined as the mean number of infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population 3, 4. Population estimates of R0 can obscure considerable individual variation in infectiousness, as highlighted during the global emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by numerous ‘superspreading events’ in which certain individuals infected unusually large numbers of secondary cases 5–10. For diseases transmitted by non-sexual direct contacts, such as SARS or smallpox, individual variation is difficult to measure empirically, and thus its importance for outbreak dynamics has been unclear 2, 10, 11. Here we present an integrated theoretical and statistical analysis of the influence of individual variation in infectiousness on disease emergence. Using contact tracing data from eight directly transmitted diseases, we show that the distribution of individual infectiousness around R0 is often highly skewed. Model predictions accounting for this variation differ sharply from average-based approaches, with disease extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer but more explosive. Using these models, we explore implications for outbreak control, showing that individual-specific control measures outperform population- wide measures. Moreover, the dramatic improvements achieved through targeted control policies emphasize the need to identify predictive correlates of higher infectiousness. Our findings indicate that superspreading is a normal feature of disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we propose a rigorous definition for superspreading events and a method to predict their frequency.},

   Pages = {1-16},
   Abstract = {Multi-patch models - also known as metapopulation models - provide a simple framework within which the role of spatial processes in disease transmission can be examined. An n-patch model which distinguishes between k different classes of individuals is considered. the linear stability of spatially homogeneous solutions of such models is studied using an extension of an analysis technique previously described for a population setting in which individuals migrate between patches according to a simple linear term. The technique considerably simplifies the analysis as it decouples the nk dimensional linearized system into n distinct k-dimensional systems. An important feature of the spatial epidemiological model is that the spatial coupling may involve non-linear terms. As an example of the use of this technique, the dynamical behavior in the vicinity of the endemic equilibrium of a symmetric SIR model is decomposed into spatial modes. For parameter values appropriate for childhood diseases, expressions for the eigenvalues corresponding to in-phase and out-of-phase modes are obtained, and it is shown that the dominant mode of the system is an in-phase mode. Furthermore, the out-of-phase modes are shown to decay much more rapidly than the in-phase mode for a broad range of coupling strengths. },

The objective of lour study was to determine both the frequency of such outbreaks and their clinical and epidemiological features. Methods: Prospective surveillance for outbreaks of respiratory tract infections and a retrospective audit of surveillance records were conducted in 5 nursing homes in metropolitan Toronto over 3 years. The clinical manifestations of infected residents were identified and microbiological investigations for causal agents were conducted. Results: Sixteen outbreaks, involving 480 of 1313 residents, were identified prospectively during 1 144 208 resident-days of surveillance, for an overall rate of 0.42 infections per 1000 resident-days. Another 30 outbreaks, involving 388 residents, were identified retrospectively. Outbreaks occurred year-round, with no seasonal pattern. Pathogens included influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Legionella sainthelensi and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Multiple pathogens were detected in 38% (6/16) of the prospectively identified outbreaks. Of the 480 residents in the prospectively identified outbreaks 398 (83%) had a cough, 194 (40%) had fever and 215 (45%) had coryza. Clinical findings were nonspecific and could not be used to distinguish between causal agents. Pneumonia developed in 72 (15%) of the 480 residents, and 58 (12%) required transfer to hospital. The case-fatality rate was 8% (37/480). Interpretation: Our findings emphasize the importance of adequate surveillance for outbreaks of respiratory tract infections in nursing homes and of early diagnosis so that appropriate interventions can be promptly instituted.},

   Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the implementation of the Canadian contingency plan for viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) in response to a suspected case. SETTING: A 300-bed, tertiary-care, university-affiliated hospital. PARTICIPANTS: A 32-year-old Congolese woman admitted to the hospital with suspected VHF in February 2001. Contact evaluation included hospital healthcare workers and laboratory staff. INTERVENTION: Enhanced isolation precautions were implemented in the patient care setting to prevent nosocomial transmission. Contact tracing and evaluation of close and high-risk contacts with symptoms was conducted. Laboratory precautions included barrier precautions and diversion of specimens. Communication occurred to both hospital employees and the media. RESULTS: Three high-risk contacts, 13 close contacts, and 60 casual contacts were identified. Two close contacts became symptomatic and required evaluation. Challenging process issues included tracing of laboratory specimens, decontamination of laboratory equipment, and internal and external communication. After 5 days, a transmissible VHF of public health consequence was ruled out in the index case. CONCLUSION: Contingency plans for VHF can be implemented in an efficient and feasible manner. Contact tracing, laboratory issues, internal communication, and media interest can be anticipated to be the key challenges (Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2003;24:280-283).},

Exposure to antimicrobial agents was measured during the 10 weeks prior to detection of targeted resistant bacteria in residents and compared with antibiotic exposure during a 10- week interval in individuals with sensitive organisms. These main effects were adjusted for infection-control and staffing covariates using multiple logistic regression modeling. Increased staffing of nursing homes with registered nurses (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=0.79 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72, 0.87) per registered nurse per 100 resident-days) and use of antibacterial soap (adjusted OR=0.40, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.90) were associated with reduced risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in nursing home residents. An increase in the number of hand-washing sinks per 100 residents was shown to reduce the risk of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX)- resistant Enterobacteriaceae (adjusted OR=0.94, 95% CI: 0.90, 0.98). Exposure to TMP-SMX and exposure to fluoroquinolones were significant risk factors for isolation of TMP-SMX- resistant Enterobacteriaciae (adjusted OR=1.14, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.22) and fluoroquinolone-resistant Enterobacteriaciae (adjusted OR=1.08, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.11), respectively. These findings suggest that increased staffing, more hand-washing sinks, and use of antimicrobial soap may reduce resistance to antimicrobial agents in long-term care facilities.},

   Abstract = {Background: Little is known about the risk factors, outcome, and impact of pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in residents of long-term care facilities. Objective: To determine the risk factors and the effect of these infections on functional status and clinical course. Methods: Active surveillance for these infections was conducted for 475 residents in 5 nursing homes from July 1, 1993, through June 30, 1996. Information regarding potential risk factors for these infections, functional status, transfers to hospital, and death was also obtained. Results: Two hundred seventy-two episodes of pneumonia and other LRTIs occurred in 170 residents during 228 757 days of surveillance for an incidence of 1.2 episodes per 1000 resident-days. Multivariable analysis revealed that older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.6 per 10-year interval; P = .01), male sex (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.5; P = .03), swallowing difficulty (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2-3.3; P = .01), and the inability to take oral medications (OR, 8.3; 95% CI, 1.4-50.3; P = .02) were significant risk factors for pneumonia; receipt of influenza vaccine (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3-0.5; P = .01) was protective. Age (OR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.0-2.5] per 10-year interval; P = .05) and immobility (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.8-3.8; P = .01) were significant risk factors for other LRTIs, and influenza vaccination was protective (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.2-0.4; P = .01).

Conclusions: Swallowing difficulty and lack of influenza vaccination are important, modifiable risks for pneumonia and other LRTIs in elderly residents of long-term care facilities.

If the basic reproductive number (R0) was below 1.60, our simulations showed that a prepared response with targeted antivirals would have a high probability of containing the disease. In that case, an antiviral agent stockpile on the order of 100,000 to 1 million courses for treatment and prophylaxis would be sufficient. If pre-vaccination occurred, then targeted antiviral prophylaxis could be effective for containing strains with an R0 as high as 2.1. Combinations of targeted antiviral prophylaxis, pre-vaccination, and quarantine could contain strains with an R0 as high as 2.4.},

   Abstract = {Despite evidence that vaccinating schoolchildren against influenza is effective in limiting community-level transmission, the United States has had a long-standing government strategy of recommending that vaccine be concentrated primarily in high-risk groups and distributed to those people who keep the health system and social infrastructure operating. Because of this year's influenza vaccine shortage, a plan was enacted to distribute the limited vaccine stock to these groups first. This vaccination strategy, based on direct protection of those most at risk, has not been very effective in reducing influenza morbidity and mortality. Although it is too late to make changes this year, the current influenza vaccine crisis affords the opportunity to examine an alternative for future years. The alternative plan, supported by mathematical models and influenza field studies, would be to concentrate vaccine in schoolchildren, the population group most responsible for transmission, while also covering the reachable high-risk groups, who would also receive considerable indirect protection. In conjunction with a plan to ensure an adequate vaccine supply, this alternative influenza vaccination strategy would help control interpandemic influenza and be instrumental in preparing for pandemic influenza. The effectiveness of the alternative plan could be assessed through nationwide community studies.},

   Pages = {867-881},
   Abstract = {Sexual selection is responsible for much of the spectacular natural diversity of mating traits. It is unclear, however, how this powerful evolutionary force affects the evolution of traits unrelated to mating. Four recent theoretical studies have argued that sexual selection might increase the rate of adaptation, but each relies on the assumption of a substantial positive covariance between male condition (non-mating fitness) and display. Here we demonstrate, with an explicit genetic model, that sexual selection itself can easily lead to the evolution and maintenance of this covariance. This process occurs through the evolution of condition-dependent male display and the resultant transfer of genetic variance for condition into variance in male display. We also track the effect of the covariance between condition and display on the rate of adaptation. Our results demonstrate a powerful synergy between natural and sexual selection that can elevate population mean fitness. !  Moreover, this synergy can greatly accelerate the rate of adaptation, making the feedback between natural and sexual selection a particularly potent force in changing environments. This has important implications for several key evolutionary processes, including the evolution of sex, sexual conflict and speciation.},

   Abstract = {The handicap principle (Zahavi, 1975, 1987; Zahavi and Zahavi, 1997) is now widely used to explain the evolution of conspicuous signals such as tail ornaments, courtship displays, and nestling begging (Godfray, 1991; Grafen, 1990a, b; Johnston, 1997; Maynard Smith and Harper, 1995). The essence of the model is that signals must be costly to be honest. Females have evolved preferences for males with longer tails or brighter plumage, for example, because only males of high quality can survive and perform with handicapping ornaments. Despite the general acceptance that the handicap principle explains extravagant morphological and behavioral signals, the model's mechanism has not been broadly applied to explain a host of other behaviors. Here we suggest that the selection on animal behavior to be performed differently when observed by other animals can lead to significant quantitative changes in behavior.},

   Journal = {Immunological Reviews},
   Volume = {216},
   Pages = {9-20},
   Abstract = {The types of mathematical models used in immunology and their scope have changed drastically in the past 10 years. Classical models were based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs), difference equations, and cellular automata. These models focused on the 'simple' dynamics obtained between a small number of reagent types (e.g. one type of receptor and one type of antigen or two T-cell populations). With the advent of high-throughput methods, genomic data, and unlimited computing power, immunological modeling shifted toward the informatics side. Many current applications of mathematical models in immunology are now focused around the concepts of high-throughput measurements and system immunology (immunomics), as well as the bioinformatics analysis of molecular immunology. The types of models have shifted from mainly ODEs of simple systems to the extensive use of Monte Carlo simulations. The transition to a more molecular and more computer-based attitude is similar to the one occurring over all the fields of complex systems analysis. An interesting additional aspect in theoretical immunology is the transition from an extreme focus on the adaptive immune system (that was considered more interesting from a theoretical point of view) to a more balanced focus taking into account the innate immune system also. We here review the origin and evolution of mathematical modeling in immunology and the contribution of such models to many important immunological concepts.},

   Journal = {PLoS Pathogens},
   Volume = {3},
   Number = {10},
   Pages = {e151},
   Abstract = {Using the guinea pig as a model host, we show that aerosol spread of influenza virus is dependent upon both ambient relative humidity and temperature. Twenty experiments performed at relative humidities from 20% to 80% and 5 °C, 20 °C, or 30 °C indicated that both cold and dry conditions favor transmission. The relationship between transmission via aerosols and relative humidity at 20 °C is similar to that previously reported for the stability of influenza viruses (except at high relative humidity, 80%), implying that the effects of humidity act largely at the level of the virus particle. For infected guinea pigs housed at 5 °C, the duration of peak shedding was approximately 40 h longer than that of animals housed at 20 °C; this increased shedding likely accounts for the enhanced transmission seen at 5 °C. To investigate the mechanism permitting prolonged viral growth, expression levels in the upper respiratory tract of several innate immune mediators were determined. Innate responses proved to be comparable between animals housed at 5 °C and 20 °C, suggesting that cold temperature (5 °C) does not impair the innate immune response in this system. Although the seasonal epidemiology of influenza is well characterized, the underlying reasons for predominant wintertime spread are not clear. We provide direct, experimental evidence to support the role of weather conditions in the dynamics of influenza and thereby address a long-standing question fundamental to the understanding of influenza epidemiology and evolution.},

   Volume = {1},
   Abstract = {Using the guinea pig model, we have previously shown that the aerosol transmission of a seasonal human influenza virus is blocked by humid (80\% relative humidity) or warm (30°C) ambient conditions. In contrast, we found that transmission by a contact route proceeded at high efficiency despite increased temperature or humidity. Based on these findings, and the observed seasonal behavior of influenza viruses in various regions of the world, we hypothesize herein that the predominant mode of influenza virus transmission differs in temperate and tropical climates. Specifically, we predict that aerosol transmission predominates during the winter season in temperate regions, while contact is the major mode of spread in the tropics. With this idea in mind, possible explanations for the current summer-time spread of swine-origin influenza viruses are discussed.},

Further, the global stability of an infection-free periodic solution is analyzed. And the existence of a nontrivial periodic solution (endemic) is considered by using bifurcation theory.

This feature greatly complicates the analysis of the spread of infection within a population. Here it is shown that this dependence upon elapsed time can be ignored, if attention is restricted to the distribution of the final sizes of epidemics. For every epidemic, there is a corresponding Markov chain which has the same final size distribution. Such Markov chains are constructed (a) for models where there are several types of infectives, but only one type of susceptible individual, and (b) if there are several types of susceptibles, but only one infective type. Some qualitative differences between these models are illustrated.},

   Abstract = {By considering the interaction of a single stellar orbit with a weak $\cos{2\phi}$ potential it is shown that in the central regions of galaxies with slowly rising rotation curves, the elongations of the orbits will align along any potential valley and oscillate about it.  This effect is more pronounced for elongated orbits.  In such regions any pair of orbits will naturally align under their mutual gravity and so a bar will form.  The gravity of this bar will drive a spiral structure in the outer parts of the galaxy where differential rotation is too strong to allow the orbits to be caught by the bar.  The spiral structure carries a torque which slowly drains angular momentum from the bar, gradually making its outline more eccentric and slowing its pattern speed.  In the outer parts of the bar only the more eccentric orbits align with the potential valley;  the rounder ones form a ring or lens about the bar.  As the pattern speed slows down, the corotation resonance and outer Lindblad resonace, which receive the angular momentum, move outwards.  The evolution of the system is eventually slowed down by the weakness of these outer resonances where ther material is rather sparse.},

We show that the presence of waves lower the angular momentum in the inner parts and increases it in the outer parts.  Further there is absorption of angular momentum by stars that resonate with the wave at the outer Lindblad resonance, and at corotation.  Emission of angular momentum occurs at the inner Lindblad resonance.  The role of spiral structure is to carry angular momentum from the inner parts to the outer parts so that the waves may grow.
We consider bars in galaxies to be standing waves which have grown enough to orient and trap the major axes of orbits with two lobes so that they lie along the bar.},

The invariant concepts of the load, $\lambda$, of a vortex line and the metage, $\mu$, of a point on that line are introduced and used to define the surfaces of constant load.  It is shown that the content of Kelvin's circulation theorem is contained in the conservation of the function $C(\lambda)$ which gives the circulations around the large vortex tubes that make the surfaces of constant load.  Two flows are isocirculational if and only if their $C(\lambda)$-functions are the same.
A new Lagrangian for inviscid barotropic fluid mechanics that uses $\rho$,  $\lambda$, $\dot\rho$, $\dot\lambda$ as variables is shown to yield the fluid equations in Clebsch's form.  An energy functional that yields all steady flows as its stationary points is deduced.  Its minimization yields stable inviscid barotropic flows.},

   Journal = {New England Journal of Medicine},
   Volume = {347},
   Number = {19},
   Pages = {1477-1482},
   Abstract = {Background: It has been suggested that vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) is a cause of autism. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all children born in Denmark from January 1991 through December 1998. The cohort was selected on the basis of data from the Danish Civil Registration System, which assigns a unique identification number to every live-born infant and new resident in Denmark. MMR-vaccination status was obtained from the Danish National Board of Health. Information on the children's autism status was obtained from the Danish Psychiatric Central Register, which contains information on all diagnoses received by patients in psychiatric hospitals and outpatient clinics in Denmark. We obtained information on potential confounders from the Danish Medical Birth Registry, the National Hospital Registry, and Statistics Denmark. Results: Of the 537,303 children in the cohort (representing 2,129,864 person-years), 440,655 (82.0 percent) had received the MMR vaccine. We identified 316 children with a diagnosis of autistic disorder and 422 with a diagnosis of other autistic-spectrum disorders. After adjustment for potential confounders, the relative risk of autistic disorder in the group of vaccinated children, as compared with the unvaccinated group, was 0.92 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.68 to 1.24), and the relative risk of another autistic-spectrum disorder was 0.83 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.65 to 1.07). There was no association between the age at the time of vaccination, the time since vaccination, or the date of vaccination and the development of autistic disorder. Conclusions: This study provides strong evidence against the hypothesis that MMR vaccination causes autism.},

In this study, selected 2009 A(H1N1) influenza isolates were assessed for their ability to cause disease in mice and ferrets and compared with a contemporary seasonal H1N1 virus for their ability to transmit to naive ferrets through respiratory droplets. In contrast to seasonal influenza H1N1 virus, 2009 A(H1N1) influenza viruses caused increased morbidity, replicated to higher titers in lung tissue, and were recovered from the intestinal tract of intranasally inoculated ferrets. The 2009 A(H1N1) influenza viruses exhibited less efficient respiratory droplet transmission in ferrets in comparison with the highly transmissible phenotype of a seasonal H1N1 virus. Transmission of the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza viruses was further corroborated by characterizing the binding specificity of the viral hemagglutinin to the sialylated glycan receptors (in the human host) by use of dose-dependent direct receptor-binding and human lung tissue-binding assays.},

   Abstract = {A key issue for the study of tuberculosis is to understand why individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) experience different clinical outcomes. To better understand the dynamics of Mtb infection and immunity, we have previously developed a temporal mathematical model that qualitatively and quantitatively characterizes the cellular and cytokine control network during infection. In this work we extend that model to a two compartmental model to capture the important processes of cellular activation and priming that occur between the lung and the nearest draining lymph node. We are able to reproduce typical disease progression scenarios including primary infection, latency or clearance. Then we use the model to predict key processes determining these different disease trajectories (i.e. identify bifurcation parameters), suggesting directions for further basic science study and potential new treatment strategies.

   Journal = {Journal of Virology},
   Volume = {78},
   Number = {20},
   Pages = {11130-11141},
   Abstract = {Most studies on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication kinetics or fitness must rely on a particular assay to initially standardize inocula from virus stocks. The most accurate measure of infectious HIV-1 titers involves a limiting dilution-infection assay and a calculation of the dose required for 50\% infectivity of susceptible cells in tissue culture (TCID50). Surrogate assays are now commonly used to measure the amount of p24 capsid, the endogenous reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, or the amount of viral genomic RNA in virus particles. However, a direct comparison of these surrogate assays and actual infectious HIV-1 titers from TCID50 assays has not been performed with even the most conserved laboratory strains, let alone the highly divergent primary HIV-1 isolates of different subtypes. This study indicates that endogenous RT activity, not p24 content or viral RNA load, is the best surrogate measure of infectious HIV-1 titer in both cell-free supernatants and viruses purified on sucrose cushions. Sequence variation between HIV-1 subtypes did not appear to affect the function or activity of the RT enzyme in this endogenous assay but did affect the detection of p24 capsid by both enzyme immunoassays and Western blots. Clear groupings of non-syncytium-inducing (NSI), CCR5-tropic (R5), and SI/CXCR4-tropic (X4) HIV-1 isolates were observed when we compared the slopes derived from correlations of RT activity with infectious titers. Finally, the replication efficiency or fitness of both the NSI/R5 and SI/X4 HIV-1 isolates was not linked to the titers of the virus stocks.},

   Abstract = {Animals; are predominantly risk prone toward reward delays and risk averse toward reward amounts. Humans in turn tend to be risk-seeking for losses and risk averse for gains. To explain the human results, Prospect Theory postulates a convex utility for losses and concave utility for gains. In contrast, Scalar Utility Theory (SUT) explains the animal data by postulating that the cognitive representation of outcomes follows Weber's Law, namely that the spread of the distribution of expected outcomes is proportional to its mean. SLIT also would explain human results if utility (even if it is linear on expected outcome) followed Weber's Law, We present an experiment that simulates losses and gains in a bird, the European Starling, to test the implication of SLIT that risk proneness/aversion should extend to any aversive/desirable dimension other than time and amount of reward. Losses and gains were simulated by offering choices of fixed vs. variable outcomes with lower or higher outcomes than what the birds expected. The subjects were significantly more risk prone for losses than for gains but, against expectations, they were not significantly risk averse toward gains. The results are thus, in part, consistent with Prospect Theory and SUIT and show that risk attitude in humans and birds may obey a common fundamental principle.},

   Journal = {Proceedings of the Royal Society B-Biological Sciences},
   Volume = {281},
   Number = {1783},
   Abstract = {More than a century of ecological studies have demonstrated the importance of demography in shaping spatial and temporal variation in population dynamics. Surprisingly, the impact of seasonal recruitment on infectious disease systems has received much less attention. Here, we present data encompassing 78 years of monthly natality in the USA, and reveal pronounced seasonality in birth rates, with geographical and temporal variation in both the peak birth timing and amplitude. The timing of annual birth pulses followed a latitudinal gradient, with northern states exhibiting spring/summer peaks and southern states exhibiting autumn peaks, a pattern we also observed throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Additionally, the amplitude of United States birth seasonality was more than twofold greater in southern states versus those in the north. Next, we examined the dynamical impact of birth seasonality on childhood disease incidence, using a mechanistic model of measles. Birth seasonality was found to have the potential to alter the magnitude and periodicity of epidemics, with the effect dependent on both birth peak timing and amplitude. In a simulation study, we fitted an susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model to simulated data, and demonstrated that ignoring birth seasonality can bias the estimation of critical epidemiological parameters. Finally, we carried out statistical inference using historical measles incidence data from New York City. Our analyses did not identify the predicted systematic biases in parameter estimates. This may be owing to the well-known frequency-locking between measles epidemics and seasonal transmission rates, or may arise from substantial uncertainty in multiple model parameters and estimation stochasticity.},

   Abstract = {This article describes the functionality of a cellular automata-based immune system simulator, which we call SIS (synthetic immune system). SIS is based on descriptive cellular states and rules that define transitions between these states to model an entire immune system. Through the use of this program, an immunologist can test the validity of a proposed model by observing how it responds to self and non-self antigen. The output is then compared with the behavior of a real protective immune system, and the model can then be ruled as being adequate or inadequate. SIS-I, the first version of SIS written, has been modified through the years and is now available on our Web site (http://www.cig.salk.edu/sis-I/sis.html). Although SIS-I has some flexibility, it has many hardwired values as well as a predefined keyword language for writing immune system rules. SIS-II was developed from SIS-I and allows the user to change more variables and to define keywords used within the program. Herein, we give an overview on how to use SIS-I and SIS-II, along with a future direction, SIS-III.},

Ferrets are used as an animal model for the study of influenza because they are susceptible to human influenza viruses and develop some of the symptoms of influenza that are seen in humans.

   Abstract = {The parent viruses and clones 64c and 6 of the A/Puerto Rico/8/34-A/England/939/69 (H3N2) series were examined. Virulence was assessed from 50\% infectious dose, replication in the upper respiratory tract, degree of lung infection, and production of fever. Viral infection of the upper respiratory tract declined with onset of the inflammatory response and pyrexia, and restriction of replication in nasal turbinate tissue at pyrexial temperatures correlated with onset and rapidity of decline of infection in the upper respiratory tract. Compared with the H3N2 strains, the HONl strain of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 stimulated a lower and later inflammatory response, which correlated with a delayed and low fever and, in turn, a high nasal infection that was slow to decline. The differential ability to infect the lung in vivo (clones 64c and 6 more than A/England/ 939/69 and clone 7a more than A/Puerto Rico/8/34 and clone 64d) was not always explained by differences in ability to replicate in lung tissue at normal or pyrexial temperatures. Neither overall virulence nor any particular facet of it can yet be correlated with particular gene pieces. The results are discussed in relation to the virulence of the strains for humans.},

   Abstract = {Currently most attempts at cancer immunotherapy involve the generation of CD8 cytotoxic 
T lymphocytes (CTLs) against tumor-associated antigens. Many tumors, however, have been 
immunoselected to evade recognition by CTLs and thus alternative approaches to cancer 
immunotherapy are urgently needed. Here we demonstrate that CD4 T cells that recognize a 
secreted tumor-specific antigen and exhibit a cytokine secretion profile characteristic of Th2 
cells, are capable of clearing established lung and visceral metastases of a CTL-resistant melanoma. 
Clearance of lung metastases by the Th2 cells was found to be totally dependent on the 
eosinophil chemokine, eotaxin, and partially dependent on the transcription activator signal 
transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6), with degranulating eosinophils within the 
tumors inducing tumor regression. In contrast, tumor-specific CD4 Th1 cells, that recruited 
macrophages into the tumors, had no effect on tumor growth. This work provides the basis for 
a new approach to adoptive T cell immunotherapy of cancer. },

   Abstract = {Context Metabolife 356, a multicomponent dietary supplement containing ephedra and caffeine (DSEC) in addition to several other components, is the top-selling dietary weight loss supplement. Given its common use, anecdotal reports of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular adverse events, and paucity of safety data, further research with this DSEC was warranted. Objective To determine the impact of the DSEC on corrected QT (QTc) interval duration and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Design Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study conducted from January to May 2003. Setting and Participants Fifteen healthy volunteers (mean [SD] age, 26.7 [2.52] years; weight, 72.7 [14.93] kg), 6 (40%) of whom were women, recruited from the University of Connecticut, Storrs campus. Intervention A single dose of the DSEC (containing 19 ingredients including ephedra [12 mg] and caffeine [40 mg]) or matching placebo were administered in a crossover fashion with a 7-day washout period between treatments, Main Outcome Measures Maximal QTc interval and SBP assessed at 1, 3, and 5 hours after dosing for the DSEC relative to placebo. Results Individuals receiving the DSEC had a longer maximal QTc interval (mean [SD], 419.4 [11.8] vs 396.1 [15.7] milliseconds; P<.001) and higher SBP (mean [SD], 123.5 [10.98] vs 118.93 [9.62] mm Hg; P=.009) compared with placebo. Participants who received the DSEC were more likely to experience a QTc interval increase of at least 30 milliseconds vs placebo (8 individuals [53.3%] vs 1 individual [6.7%]; relative risk, 2.67 [95% confidence interval, 1.40-5.10]). There were no significant sex-related differences. Conclusions The ephedra- and caffeine-containing dietary supplement Metabolife 356 increased the mean maximal QTc interval and SBP. Since the actual ingredient or ingredients in Metabolife 356 responsible for these findings are not known, patients should be instructed to avoid this and similar dietary supplements until more information is known about their safety.},

   Abstract = {The foot-and-mouth crisis which hit the UK in 2001 was instrumental in wreaking substantial political and economic damage. It resulted in the delaying of a general election, the abolition of the Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF), a near-decimation of the farming industry and a cost to taxpayers of pound2.7 billion. The article explores the main political factors which shaped the Blair government's response to a 'scientific' problem. In particular, it examines (1) the influence of public opinion, (2) the role of the National Farmers Union, (3) the bureaucratic politics of fragmentation and the failure of MAFF, and (4) international pressures from the EU and the slump in tourism. Its central theme is that the management of crisis is driven by 'politics' as opposed to 'rationality'.},

   Abstract = {Some combinations of musical notes are consonant (pleasant), whereas others are dissonant (unpleasant), a distinction central to music. Explanations of consonance in terms of acoustics, auditory neuroscience, and enculturation have been debated for centuries [1-12]. We utilized individual differences to distinguish the candidate theories. We measured preferences for musical chords as well as nonmusical sounds that isolated particular acoustic factors-specifically, the beating and the harmonic relationships between frequency components, two factors that have long been thought to potentially underlie consonance [2, 3, 10, 13-20]. Listeners preferred stimuli without beats and with harmonic spectra, but across more than 250 subjects, only the preference for harmonic spectra was consistently correlated with preferences for consonant over dissonant chords. Harmonicity preferences were also correlated with the number of years subjects had spent playing a musical instrument, suggesting that exposure to music amplifies preferences for harmonic frequencies because of their musical importance. Harmonic spectra are prominent features of natural sounds, and our results indicate that they also underlie the perception of consonance.},

   Abstract = {The criteria to assess public health policies are fundamental to policy optimization. Using a model parametrized with survey-based contact data and mortality data from influenza pandemics, we determined optimal vaccine allocation for five outcome measures: deaths, infections, years of life lost, contingent valuation, and economic costs. We find that optimal vaccination is achieved by prioritization of schoolchildren and adults aged 30 to 39 years. Schoolchildren are most responsible for transmission, and their parents serve as bridges to the rest of the population. Our results indicate that consideration of age-specific transmission dynamics is paramount to the optimal allocation of influenza vaccines. We also found that previous and new CDC recommendations for both the novel swine-origin 
influenza, and particularly for seasonal influenza, are suboptimal for all outcome measures. },

Assuming 100 persons initially infected and 3 persons infected per infectious person, quarantine alone could stop disease transmission but would require a minimum daily removal rate of 50% of those with overt symptoms. Vaccination would stop the outbreak within 365 days after release only if disease transmission were reduced to greater than or equal to0.85 persons infected per infectious person. A combined vaccination and quarantine campaign could stop an outbreak if a daily quarantine rate of 25% were achieved and vaccination reduced smallpox transmission by greater than or equal to 33%. In such a scenario, approximately 4,200 cases would occur and 365 days would be needed to stop the outbreak. Historical data indicate that a median of 2,155 smallpox vaccine doses per case were given to stop outbreaks, implying that a stockpile of 40 million doses should be adequate.},

A two year, multicenter. double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy field trial in pre-school aged children was conducted; 1602 enrolled in Year One and 1358 (85%) returned in Year Two. In both study years combined, the overall vaccine efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza was 92% (95% CI: 88, 94). The vaccine efficacy was 95% (95% CI: 62, 99) against lower respiratory illness, 94% (95% CI: 90, 96) against febrile illness and 96% (95% CI: 88, 99) against otitis media associated with culture-confirmed influenza. A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, effectiveness field trial was conducted in 4561 working adults aged 18 to 64 years. Episodes and days of Febrile illness (FI), severe febrile illness (SFI), febrile upper respiratory illness (FURI), work loss. and health care use were assessed. Vaccination significantly reduced the numbers of SFI, 18.8% reduction (95% CI: 7, 29), and FURI, 26.3% reduction (95% CI: 13, 33): and led to fewer days of illness (22.9% reduction for FI, 27.3% reduction for SFI), fewer days of work lost (17.9% reduction for SFI, 28.4% for FURI), and fewer days of health care provider visits (24.8% for SFI, 40.9% for FURI). Prescription antibiotics and over-the- counter medications were also reduced. The vaccine was generally safe and well tolerated with no vaccine related serious adverse events.

Here we report experimental evolution of learning ability in Drosophila melanogaster. We exposed experimental populations for 51 generations to conditions that we expected to favor associative learning with regard to oviposition substrate choice. Flies that learned to associate a chemical cue (quinine) with a particular substrate, and still avoided this substrate several hours after the cue had been removed, were expected to contribute more alleles to the next generation. From about generation 15 on, the experimental populations showed marked ability to avoid oviposition substrates that several hours earlier had contained the chemical cue. The improved response to conditioning was also expressed when the flies were faced with a choice of novel media. We demonstrate that these behavioral changes are caused by the evolution of both a higher learning rate and a better memory.},

Recently there has been considerable interest in linking within- and between-host levels of disease dynamics in the study of pathogen evolution. Here we review the extent to which these nested models have increased our understanding of pathogen evolution. We suggest that, although such models have been useful for deter- mining the nature of tradeoffs between epidemiological parameters and for evaluating the consequences of con- flicting selection pressures at different scales, the vast majority of previous results could likely have been obtained without the use of nested models per se. Nevertheless, these models have proven very useful through their highlighting of the importance of within- host disease dynamics on pathogen evolution.},

   Abstract = {The problem of sustaining a public resource that everybody is free to overuse-the 'tragedy of the commons'(1-7)-emerges in many social dilemmas, such as our inability to sustain the global climate. Public goods experiments(4), which are used to study this type of problem, usually confirm that the collective benefit will not be produced. Because individuals and countries often participate in several social games simultaneously, the interaction of these games may provide a sophisticated way by which to maintain the public resource. Indirect reciprocity(8), 'give and you shall receive', is built on reputation and can sustain a high level of cooperation, as shown by game theorists(9-11). Here we show, through alternating rounds of public goods and indirect reciprocity games, that the need to maintain reputation for indirect reciprocity maintains contributions to the public good at an unexpectedly high level. But if rounds of indirect reciprocation are not expected, then contributions to the public good drop quickly to zero. Alternating the games leads to higher profits for all players. As reputation may be a currency that is valid in many social games, our approach could be used to test social dilemmas for their solubility.},

   Abstract = {We consider an infectious disease spreading along the edges of a network which may have significant clustering. The individuals in the population have heterogeneous infectiousness and/or susceptibility. We define the out-transmissibility of a node to be the marginal probability that it would infect a randomly chosen neighbor given its infectiousness and the distribution of susceptibility. For a given distribution of out-transmissibility, we find the conditions which give the upper (or lower) bounds on the size and probability of an epidemic, under weak assumptions on the transmission properties, but very general assumptions on the network. We find similar bounds for a given distribution of in-transmissibility (the marginal probability of being infected by a neighbor). We also find conditions giving global upper bounds on the size and probability. The distributions leading to these bounds are network independent. In the special case of networks with high girth (locally tree-like), we are able to prove stronger results. In general, the probability and size of epidemics are maximal when the population is homogeneous and minimal when the variance of in- or out-transmissibility is maximal.},

   Abstract = {Recent work by Volz (J Math Biol 56:293-310, 2008) has shown how to calculate the growth and eventual decay of an SIR epidemic on a static random network, assuming infection and recovery each happen at constant rates. This calculation allows us to account for effects due to heterogeneity and finiteness of degree that are neglected in the standard mass-action SIR equations. In this note we offer an alternate derivation which arrives at a simpler-though equivalent-system of governing equations to that of Volz. This new derivation is more closely connected to the underlying physical processes, and the resulting equations are of comparable complexity to the mass-action SIR equations. We further show that earlier derivations of the final size of epidemics on networks can be reproduced using the same approach, thereby providing a common framework for calculating both the dynamics and the final size of an epidemic spreading on a random network. Under appropriate assumptions these equations reduce to the standard SIR equations, and we are able to estimate the magnitude of the error introduced by assuming the SIR equations.},

   Pages = {250--256},
   Abstract = {Irreversibility in stellar dynamical systems was studied by means of numerical experiments using $n$-body calculations carried out in a computer for $n$ up to 32.  In the experiments, two similar systems evolve simultaneously and the separation of their representative points in phase space was observed to grow exponentially with the time variable because of the effects of encounters.  The time constant of this exponential growth defines a relaxation time different from the usual relaxation time of stellar dynamics.  Certain properties of the calculation and comparisons of the observed values of this relaxation time with values expected on the basis of binary collisions led to the conclusion that $n$-body systems with inverse-square law forces behave as tightly coupled systems.  The time constant is surprisingly short---about $4\tau/n$, where $\tau$ is the mean time between binary collisions of one particle.  Hard spheres or [repulsive] $r^{-6}$ potentials do not show the collective behavior of inverse-square law systems.  Errors in calculations of $n$-body systems grow exponentially with the time through this mechanism, and may therefore invalidate the results of $n$-body calculations.},

   Abstract = {The gravitational $n$-body problem is remarkably unstable numerically, in spite of the fact that near constancy of the energy and angular momentum makes it appear that the calculation should be reliable.  In an attempt to understand why this should be so, the properties of numerical solutions were explored through a perturbation technique in which equations of motion for the differences between two systems are integrated numerically.  Results of a series of experiments show that the differences between computed systems and exact solutions to the differential equations tend to lie near the hypersurface on which the first integrals are conserved and preferentially along the trajectory through the $\Gamma$-space.  The numerical instability remains even when conservation of the first integrals is improved by several orders of magnitude through a partial iterative refinement method.  Implications of these results concerning the utility of computations of the gravitational $n$-body problem are discussed.  It may be possible to treat numerical effects as a kind of relaxation process, in which the relaxation time is identified with the characterisitic $e$-folding time of error growth.},

   Abstract = {The 1918 influenza pandemic killed 20 - 40 million people worldwide(1), and is seen as a worst-case scenario for pandemic planning. Like other pandemic influenza strains, the 1918 A/H1N1 strain spread extremely rapidly. A measure of transmissibility and of the stringency of control measures required to stop an epidemic is the reproductive number, which is the number of secondary cases produced by each primary case(2). Here we obtained an estimate of the reproductive number for 1918 influenza by fitting a deterministic SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model to pneumonia and influenza death epidemic curves from 45 US cities: the median value is less than three. The estimated proportion of the population with A/H1N1 immunity before September 1918 implies a median basic reproductive number of less than four. These results strongly suggest that the reproductive number for 1918 pandemic influenza is not large relative to many other infectious diseases(2). In theory, a similar novel influenza subtype could be controlled. But because influenza is frequently transmitted before a specific diagnosis is possible and there is a dearth of global antiviral and vaccine stores, aggressive transmission reducing measures will probably be required.},

   Abstract = {Knowledge of the age-specific prevalence of immunity from, and incidence of infection with, 
2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus is essential for modelling the future burden of disease and the effectiveness of interventions such as vaccination. In this cross-sectional serological survey, we obtained 1403 serum samples taken in 2008 (before the first wave of H1N1 infection) and 1954 serum samples taken in August and September, 2009 (after the first wave of infection) as part of the annual collection for the Health Protection Agency seroepidemiology programme from patients accessing health care in England. Antibody titres were measured by use of haemagglutination inhibition and microneutralisation assays. We calculated the proportion of samples with antibodies to pandemic H1N1 virus in 2008 by age group and compared the proportion of samples with haemagglutination inhibition titre 1:32 or more (deemed a protective response) before the first wave of infection with the proportion after the first wave. 
In the baseline serum samples from 2008, haemagglutination inhibition and microneutralisation antibody titres increased significantly with age (F test p<0·0001). The proportion of samples with haemagglutination inhibition titre 1:32 or more ranged from 1·8\% (three of 171; 95\% CI 0·6-5·0) in children aged 0-4 years to 31·3\% (52 of 166; 24·8-38·7) in adults aged 80 years or older. In London and the West Midlands, the difference in the proportion of samples with haemagglutination inhibition titre equal to or above 1:32 between baseline and September, 2009, was 21·3\% (95\% CI 8·8–40·3) for children younger than 5 years of age, 42·0\% (26·3–58·2) for 5-14-year-olds, and 20·6\% (1·6-42·4) for 15-24-year-olds, with no difference between baseline and September in older age groups. In other regions, only children younger than 15 years showed a significant increase from baseline (6·3\%, 1·8-12·9). Around one child in every three was infected with 2009 pandemic H1N1 in the first wave of infection in regions with a high incidence, ten times more than estimated from clinical surveillance. Pre-existing antibody in older age groups protects against infection. Children have an important role in transmission of influenza and would be a key target group for vaccination both for their protection and for the protection of others through herd immunity. },

We introduce a graphical interpretation allowing for easy derivation and communication of the model and focus on applying the technique under different assumptions about how contact rates are distributed and how long partnerships last.},

   Volume = {2},
   Number = {13},
   Pages = {R152-4},
   Abstract = {Recovery in the uptake of whole-cell pertussis vaccine from 30% in 1978 to 91% in 1992 has resulted in a major reduction in the incidence of pertussis and in the proportion of cases occurring in pre-school children. This has been accompanied by a decline in pertussis mortality rates, with no deaths reported since September 1990. Seventy-four per cent of the 50 fatal cases reported since 1980 have been infants under one year of age, demonstrating the importance of completing primary immunisation as early as possible after birth. There is no evidence, as yet, that introduction of the accelerated immunisation schedule in June 1990 has reduced the proportion of cases occurring in infants, suggesting that the decline in mortality during the last two years is largely due to indirect protection provided by the current high level of vaccine-induced herd immunity. If 90% coverage is sustained and there is no significant waning of immunity with age, the circulation of Bordetella pertussis should be sufficiently reduced to interrupt the four year epidemic cycle for the first time in the United Kingdom. The hypothesis that vaccine-induced immunity has a serotype-specific component is supported by recent changes in serotype prevalence which have followed the increase in vaccine coverage. Given the successful reinstatement of whole-cell vaccine in the UK immunisation programme, the case for replacing it with a new acellular preparation will require careful evaluation.},

   Abstract = {In countries with pertussis immunisation programmes, the main epidemiological determinant of the disease is the quality of protection induced by the vaccine and the coverage level achieved. Epidemiological data from England and Wales provide strong evidence that whole-cell pertussis Vaccines can give good protection against both clinical disease and transmission of infection, and can generate herd immunity at high coverage levels. Models of pertussis transmission indicate that, even in the absence of waning immunity, the incidence of the disease is likely to increase in older age groups in countries with sustained high coverage. Active surveillance to detect the occurrence of pertussis in adults is required as the ascertainment of such cases through passive clinical reporting systems is low. Comprehensive post-licensing surveillance of the effectiveness of acellular pertussis vaccines will be essential to assess their tong-term protection against both clinical disease and transmission of infection, and to determine the optimum boosting strategy.},

   Abstract = {We solve a long-standing stability problem for the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators. This system has attracted mathematical attention, in part because of its applications in fields ranging from neuroscience to condensed-matter physics, and also because it provides a beautiful connection between nonlinear dynamics and statistical mechanics. The model consists of a large population of phase oscillators with all-to-all sinusoidal coupling. The oscillators' intrinsic frequencies are randomly distributed across the population according to a prescribed probability density, here taken to be unimodal and symmetric about its mean. As the coupling between the oscillators is increased, the system spontaneously synchronizes: The oscillators near the center of the frequency distribution lock their phases together and run at the same frequency, while those in the tails remain unlocked and drift at different frequencies. Although this "partially locked" state has been observed in simulations for decades, its stability has never been analyzed mathematically. Part of the difficulty is in formulating a reasonable infinite-N limit of the model. Here we describe such a continuum limit, and prove that the corresponding partially locked state is, in fact, neutrally stable, contrary to what one might have expected. The possible implications of this result are discussed.},

This analysis is extended to determine the threshold level of vaccination coverage that guarantees disease eradication.},

   Journal = {Mathematical Biosciences},
   Volume = {117},
   Number = {1-2},
   Pages = {155-177},
   Abstract = {Fine and Clarkson used a discrete-time epidemic model with variable transmission parameter to analyze measles data for England and Wales for 1950-1965, during the time of biennial epidemics. Their model seems to provide a convincing fit when its parameters are estimated from these data. In particular, they obtained nearly equal estimates for the variable transmission parameter from the widely different data for epidemic and nonepidemic years. They did not, however, study the dynamics of their model. In this paper we make such a study, and find that the model is unsatisfactory in some important respects. It has a unique equilibrium (to be exact, a solution showing only seasonal variation), and neutrally stable oscillations around this equilibrium are possible, but with period approximately 3 years, not 2. (The model also has an exact 3-year cycle, while for intermediate initial values it shows unstable ''chaotic'' behavior.) If we vary the amount of variation in the transmission parameter, from no variation to 2.5 times the observed amount, the main periodicity remains approximately 3 years, though the complexity of behavior changes, increasing as the amount of variation increases. A continuous-time version of the model also has an equilibrium and a 3-year cycle, the main difference being that these are stable rather than neutrally stable. A stochastic version shows that simulations starting close to either the equilibrium or the 3-year cycle have a high probability of remaining close to the corresponding deterministic solutions for at least 20-30 years. The oscillatory features of the model are thus reasonably robust against stochastic fluctuations. We conclude that the simple homogeneous mixing model cannot be adapted to provide an adequate fit to the data, especially in explaining the observed biennial cycles. It seems likely that the pattern of seasonal variation found by Fine and Clarkson is essentially correct, but for accurate modeling of measles we need also to take into account heterogeneities of mixing in the population, especially those due to age and space.},

   Volume = {102},
   Number = {10},
   Pages = {3726-3731},
   Abstract = {Metapopulation theory provides a framework for understanding population persistence in fragmented landscapes and as such has been widely used in conservation biology to inform management of fragmented populations. However, classical metapopulation theory [Levins, R. (1970) Lect. Notes Math. 2, 75-107] ignores metapopulation structure and local population dynamics, both of which may affect extinction dynamics. Here, we investigate metapopulation dynamics in populations that are subject to different migration rates by using experimental metapopulations of the annual plant Cardamine pensylvanica. As predicted by classical metapopulation theory, connected populations persisted longer than did isolated populations, but the relationship between migration and persistence time was nonlinear. Extinction risk sharply increased as the distance between local populations increased above a threshold value that was consistent with stochastic simulations and calculation of metapopulation capacity [Hanski, I. & Ovaskainen, O. (2000) Nature 404, 755-758]. In addition, the most connected metapopulations did not have the highest persistence levels. Stochastic simulations indicated an increase in extinction risk with the highest migration rates. Moreover, calculation of population coherence [Earn, D. J. D., Levin, S. A. & Rohani, P. (2000) Science 290, 1360-1364], a metric that predicts synchronous cycles, indicated that continuous populations should cycle in phase, resulting in an increased extinction risk. Determining empirically the optimal migration level to improve survival chances will be challenging for any natural population. Migration rates that would not increase migration above the threshold value would be ineffectual, but migration rates that would homogenize local densities could increase the risk of coherent oscillations and enhance extinction risk.

   Volume = {2},

   Pages = {591-611},
   Abstract = {In this paper, a general periodic vaccination has been applied to control the spread and transmission of an infectious disease with latency. A SEIRS-1 epidemic model with general periodic vaccination strategy is analyzed. We suppose that the contact rate has period T, and the vaccination function has period LT, where L is an integer. Also we apply this strategy in a model with seasonal variation in the contact rate. Both the vaccination strategy and the contact rate are general time-dependent periodic functions. The same SEIRS models have been examined for a mixed vaccination strategy composed of both the time-dependent periodic vaccination strategy and the convention alone. A key parameter of the paper is a conjectured value R-0(c) for the basic reproduction number. We prove that the disease-free solution(DFS) is globally asymptotically stable (GAS) when R-0(sup) < 1. If R-0(inf) > 1,then the DFS is unstable,and we prove that there exists a nontrivial periodic solution whose period is the same as that of the vaccination strategy. Some persistence results are also discussed. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the eradication or control of the disease are derived. Threshold conditions for these vaccination strategies to ensure that R-0(sup) < 1 and R-0(inf) > 1 are also investigated.},

   Abstract = {Background: New antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of influenza type A and type B infections. In clinical practice, antiviral use has rarely been guided by antecedent laboratory diagnosis. Defined clinical predictors of an influenza infection can help guide timely therapy and avoid unnecessary antibiotic use. Objective: To examine which clinical signs and symptoms are most predictive of influenza infection in patients with influenzalike illness using a large data set derived from clinical trials of zanamivir. Methods: This analysis is a retrospective, pooled analysis of baseline signs and symptoms from phase 2 and 3 clinical trial participants. It was conducted in mainly unvaccinated (mean age, 35 years) adults and adolescents who had influenzalike illness, defined as having fever or feverishness plus at least 2 of the following influenzalike symptoms: headache, myalgia, cough, or sore throat who underwent laboratory testing for influenza. Clinical signs and symptoms were evaluated in statistical models to identify those best predicting laboratory confirmation of influenza. Results: Of 3744 subjects enrolled with baseline influenzalike symptoms, and included in this analysis, 2470 (66%) were confirmed to have influenza. Individuals with influenza were more likely to have cough (93% vs 80%), fever (68% vs 40%), cough and fever together (64% vs 33%), and/or nasal congestion (91% vs 81%) than those without influenza. The best multivariate predictors of influenza infections were cough and fever with a positive predictive value of 79% (P<.001). The positive predictive value rose with the increase in the temperature at the time of recruitment. Conclusion: When influenza is circulating within the community, patients with an influenzalike illness who have both cough and fever within 48 hours of symptom onset are likely to have influenza and the administration of influenza antiviral therapy may be appropriate to consider.},

   Abstract = {The occurrence of influenza was followed in Tecumseh, Michigan during the  five year period 1976-1981 by identifying onset of acute respiratory  illness and by virus isolation and serology. Type B outbreaks were observed  in 1976-1977 and 1979-1980, type A (H3N2) in 1977-1978 and 1980-1981, and  type A (H1N1) viruses in 1977-1978, 1978- 1979, and 1980-1981. Evidence of  low level circulation of viruses in the year preceding an outbreak was not  obtained. Age-specific isolation rates from specimens collected by the  community physicians differed from age-specific isolation rates from  specimens collected from the surveillance, suggesting the operation of a  selection mechanism in the former. Symptoms associated with virus isolation  were strongly influenced by age. Within age groups, several variables,  especially median duration, indicated type A (H3N2) had produced the most  severe illnesses, type A (H1N1) the mildest, with type B intermediate. Age-  specific infection rates determined by serology for the 1976-1977 and  1977-1978 influenza seasons confirmed the consistently high rates for type  A (H3N2) in children with some fall-off with increasing age. Type A (H1N1)  rates peaked in children aged 5-19 years and type B in children aged 5-14  years. This may be related in part to insensitivity of the hemagglutination  inhibition test in those under age 5 years. Infection with type A (H1N1)  was detected at low frequency in adults. Pathogenicity was calculated based  on the serologic data. It was estimated for all ages combined that, at a  minimum, type A (H3N2) infection produced febrile illness in 25% of cases  and type B infection produced respiratory illness in 34% of cases. },

Adult females had more frequent illnesses than adult males; illnesses were less common in working women than in women not working outside the home. Isolation of viruses fell with increasing age; rhinoviruses were the most common isolate. Influenza infection rates, determined serologically, suggested relative sparing of young children from infection with type A (H1N1) and type B. Infection rates were highest in adult age groups for type A (H3N2). The isolation and serological infection rates were used to estimate the extent to which laboratory procedures underestimated the proportion of respiratory illnesses caused by each infectious agent; data from other studies were also used in this estimation. Severity of respiratory illnesses was assessed by the proportion of such illnesses that res ted in consultation of a physician. Rhinoviruses produced the greatest number of consultations. Overall, physician consultations were associated with 25.4% of respiratory illnesses. },

   Abstract = {Females are expected to have different mating preferences because of the variation in costs and benefits of mate choice both between females and within individual females over a lifetime. Workers have begun to look for, and find, the expected variation among females in expressed mating preferences. However, variation within females caused by changes in intrinsic influences has not been examined in detail. Here we show that reproductive aging caused by delayed mating resulted in reduced choosiness by female Nauphoeta cinerea, a cockroach that has reproductive cycles and gives live birth. Male willingness to mate was unaffected by variation in female age. Females who were beyond the optimal mating age, 6 days postadult molt, required considerably less courtship than their younger counterparts. Females who were older when they mated had fewer offspring per clutch and fewer clutches than females who mated young. Thus, reduced choosiness was correlated with a permanent reduction in fertility. There was no difference in overall senescence among females, and thus the reduction in clutch size did not result in the expected increased lifespan. We suggest that reproductive aging in N. cinerea, similar to aging in general, occurs because the maintenance of oocytes is costly, and selection is relaxed after the optimal mating period. Our results further suggest that selection for continued choosiness is also relaxed and supports direct selection on female choosiness and a cost to choosiness.},

   Pages = {962-970},
   Abstract = {Despite the availability of published data on 4 pandemics that have occurred over the past 120 years, 
there is little modern information on the causes of death associated with inﬂuenza pandemics. 
We examined relevant information from the most recent inﬂuenza pandemic that occurred during the 
era prior to the use of antibiotics, the 1918 –1919 “Spanish ﬂu” pandemic. We examined lung tissue sections obtained 
during 58 autopsies and reviewed pathologic and bacteriologic data from 109 published autopsy series that described 
8398 individual autopsy investigations. The postmortem samples we examined from people who died of inﬂuenza during 1918 –1919 uniformly exhibited severe changes indicative of bacterial pneumonia. Bacteriologic and histopathologic results from published autopsy series clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respira- 
tory–tract bacteria in most inﬂuenza fatalities. The majority of deaths in the 1918 –1919 inﬂuenza pandemic likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory–tract bacteria. Less substantial data from the subsequent 1957 and 1968 pandemics are consistent with these ﬁndings. If severe pandemic inﬂuenza is largely a problem of viral-bacterial copathogenesis, pandemic planning needs to go beyond addressing the viral cause alone (e.g., inﬂuenza vaccines and antiviral drugs). Prevention, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of secondary bacterial pneumonia, as well as stockpiling of antibiotics and bacterial vaccines, should also be high priorities for pandemic planning. },

   Abstract = {Surveillance of wild bird populations for avian influenza viruses (AIV) contributes to our understanding of AIV evolution and ecology. Both real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) and virus isolation in embryonating chicken eggs (ECE) are standard methods for detecting AIV in swab samples from wild birds, but AIV detection rates are higher with RRT-PCR than isolation in ECE. In this study we tested duck embryos, turkey embryos, and multiple cell lines for AIV growth as compared to ECE for improved isolation and propagation of AIV for isolates representing all 16 hemagglutinin subtypes. There were no differences in low pathogenicity AIV (LPAIV) propagation titers in duck or turkey embryos compared to ECE. The replication efficiency of LPAIV was lower in each of the cell lines tested compared to ECE. LPAIV titers were 1-3 log mean tissue-culture infective doses (TCID(50)) lower in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), primary chicken embryo kidney (CEK), and primary chicken embryo fibroblast (CU) cell cultures. and 3-5 log TCID(50) lower in chicken bone marrow macrophage (HD11), chicken fibroblast (DF-1), and mink lung epithelial (Mv1Lu) cells than the corresponding mean embryo infective doses (EID(50)) in ECE. The quail fibroblast (QT-35) and baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cell lines produced titers 5-7 log TCID(50) less than EID(50) in ECE. Overall, ECEs were the most efficient system for growth of LPAIV. However, the savings in time and resources incurred with the use of due MDCK, CEK, and CEF cultures would allow a higher volume of samples to be processed with the same fiscal and financial resources, thus being potentially advantageous despite the lower replication efficiency and lower isolation rates.},

   Abstract = {\Along the lines developed by Celada and Seiden, for simulating an immune system by means of cellular automata, we have constructed a 'thymus' where T cells undergo positive and negative selection. The populations thus 'matured' have been analyzed and their performance has been tested in machina. The key feature of this thymus is to allow chance meeting and possible interaction between newly born T cells and antigen presenting cells. The latter represent both the epithelial and the dendritic cells of the biological organ and are equipped with MHC molecules that can accommodate selected self peptides. All possible specificities are represented among the virgin T cells entering the thymus, but this diversity is drastically reduced by the time they exit as mature elements. In the model organ the fate of T cells, i.e. whether they will undergo proliferation or apoptosis, is governed by their capacity to recognize MHCs and the affinity of this interaction. Crucial parameters turn out to be the concentration of presenting cells, the number of types of MHC per cell, the 'size of self' in terms of the number of different peptides and their prevalence. According to the results, events in the automaton can realize unforeseen cooperations and competitions among receptors, depending upon the interaction order and frequency, and ultimately determine the rescue or the killing of thymocytes. Thus the making of the mature T repertoire has a random component and cannot be completely predicted.},

We report here that among the 90% of respondents reporting fewer than 20 lifetime partners, however, the ratio of male to female reports drops from 3.2:1 to 1.2:1. The anomaly thus appears to be driven by the upper tail of the contact distribution, an example of the general principle of outlier influence in data analysis.

   Abstract = {A spatial simulation model of foot-and-mouth disease was used in March and early April 2001 to evaluate alternative control policies for the 2001 epidemic in Great Britain. Control policies were those in operation from March 20, 2001, and comprised a ban on all animal movements from February 23, 2001, and a stamping-out policy Each simulation commenced with the known population of infected farms on April 10, 2001, and ran for 200 days. For the control policy which best approximated that actually implemented from late Match, the model predicted an epidemic of approximately 1800 to 1900 affected farms, and estimated that the epidemic would be eradicated between July and October 2001, with a low probability of continuing beyond October 2001. This policy included the slaughter-out of infected farms within 24 hours, slaughter of about 1.3 of the surrounding farms per infected farm within a further 48 hours, and minimal interfarm movements of susceptible animals. Delays in the slaughter of animals on infected farms beyond 24 hours after diagnosis slightly increased the epidemic size, and failure to achieve pre-emptive slaughter on an adequate number of at-risk farms substantially increased the expected size of the epidemic. Vaccination of up to three of the most outbreak- dense areas carried out in conjunction with the adopted control policy reduced the predicted size of the epidemic by less than 100 farms. Vaccination of buffer zones (designed to apply available vaccine and manpower as effectively as possible) carried out in place of the adopted control policy allowed the disease to spread out of control, producing an epidemic involving over 6000 farms by October 2001, with no prospect of immediate eradication.},

Various constructions of Mather sets are explained, in which minimal solutions of variational problems play a central role.  This theory has a close relation to the differential geometric investigations by Morse and Hedlund on geodesics on two-dimensional surfaces.},

   Abstract = {Background Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route ( e. g., pandemic influenza) is increasingly being used to determine the impact of possible interventions. Although mixing patterns are known to be crucial determinants for model outcome, researchers often rely on a priori contact assumptions with little or no empirical basis. We conducted a population- based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries using a common paper- diary methodology. Methods and Findings 7,290 participants recorded characteristics of 97,904 contacts with different individuals during one day, including age, sex, location, duration, frequency, and occurrence of physical contact. We found that mixing patterns and contact characteristics were remarkably similar across different European countries. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age: schoolchildren and young adults in particular tended to mix with people of the same age. Contacts lasting at least one hour or occurring on a daily basis mostly involved physical contact, while short duration and infrequent contacts tended to be nonphysical. Contacts at home, school, or leisure were more likely to be physical than contacts at the workplace or while travelling. Preliminary modelling indicates that 5- to 19-year-olds are expected to suffer the highest incidence during the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection transmitted through social contacts measured here when the population is completely susceptible. Conclusions To our knowledge, our study provides the first large-scale quantitative approach to contact patterns relevant for infections transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route, and the results should lead to improved parameterisation of mathematical models used to design control strategies.},

We describe DIAL, (Data Integration for Alberta Laboratories), a platform allowing laboratory data to be extracted, interpreted, collated and analyzed in near real-time using secure web based technology, which is adapted from CNPHI`s Canadian Early Warning System (CEWS) technology. The development of DIAL represents a major technical advancement in the public health information management domain, building capacity for laboratory based surveillance.},

   Journal = {The Lancet},
   Volume = {368},
   Number = {9554},
   Pages = {2211-2218},
   Abstract = {The threat of an avian influenza pandemic is causing widespread public concern and health policy response, especially in high-income countries. Our aim was to use high-quality vital registration data gathered during the 1918-20 pandemic to estimate global mortality should such a pandemic occur today. We identified all countries with high-quality vital registration data for the 1918-20 pandemic and used these data to calculate excess mortality. We developed ordinary least squares regression models that related excess mortality to per-head income and absolute latitude and used these models to estimate mortality had there been an influenza pandemic in 2004. Excess mortality data show that, even in 1918-20, population mortality varied over 30-fold across countries. Per-head income explained a large fraction of this variation in mortality. Extrapolation of 1918-20 mortality rates to the worldwide population of 2004 indicates that an estimated 62 million people (10th-90th percentile range 51 million-81 million) would be killed by a similar influenza pandemic; 96\% (95\% CI 95-98) of these deaths would occur in the developing world. If this mortality were concentrated in a single year, it would increase global mortality by 114\%. This analysis of the empirical record of the 1918-20 pandemic provides a plausible upper bound on pandemic mortality. Most deaths will occur in poor countries--ie, in societies whose scarce health resources are already stretched by existing health priorities.},

Precocious maturation delays smolting; the probability of smolting in the second year for a male precocious parr is approximately 13% of that of a female.

   Abstract = {Serious concerns have been raised about the ecological effects of industrialized fishing(1-3), spurring a United Nations resolution on restoring fisheries and marine ecosystems to healthy levels(4). However, a prerequisite for restoration is a general understanding of the composition and abundance of unexploited fish communities, relative to contemporary ones. We constructed trajectories of community biomass and composition of large predatory fishes in four continental shelf and nine oceanic systems, using all available data from the beginning of exploitation. Industrialized fisheries typically reduced community biomass by 80% within 15 years of exploitation. Compensatory increases in fast-growing species were observed, but often reversed within a decade. Using a meta-analytic approach, we estimate that large predatory fish biomass today is only about 10% of pre-industrial levels. We conclude that declines of large predators in coastal regions(5) have extended throughout the global ocean, with potentially serious consequences for ecosystems(5-7). Our analysis suggests that management based on recent data alone may be misleading, and provides minimum estimates for unexploited communities, which could serve as the 'missing baseline('8) needed for future restoration efforts.},

   Volume = {31},
   Pages = {S178-S184},
   Abstract = {The febrile response is thought to be mediated by endogenous mediators, generically called "endogenous pyrogens," In the classical model of pathogenesis, induction of fever is mediated by the release of pyrogenic cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1 IL-6, and interferons into the bloodstream in response to exogenous pyrogens. These mediators act at the level of the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis in the central nervous system (CNS), inducing synthesis of prostaglandins, which are the central mediators of the coordinated responses leading to fever. However, analysis of recent data suggests that multiple pathways may be involved in the induction of fever by cytokines, such as local cytokine production leading to signaling through vagal fibers, release of cytokine-induced circulating mediators at the tissue level, the use of membrane-bound cytokines as mediators, or the local release of cytokines in the hypothalamus by circulating activated monocytes, In addition, certain bacterial products can stimulate cytokine production directly at the level of hypothalamus, probably by activation of Toll-like receptors. A multipathway mechanism for the induction of fever is therefore suggested.},

   Abstract = {The study of social networks, and in particular the spread of disease on networks, has attracted considerable recent attention in the physics community. In this paper, we show that a large class of standard epidemiological models, the so-called susceptible/infective/removed (SIR) models can be solved exactly on a wide variety of networks. In addition to the standard but unrealistic case of fixed infectiveness time and fixed and uncorrelated probability of transmission between all pairs of individuals, we solve cases in which times and probabilities are non-uniform and correlated. We also consider one simple case of an epidemic in a structured population, that of a sexually transmitted disease in a population divided into men and women. We confirm the correctness of our exact solutions with numerical simulations of SIR epidemics on networks.},

   Abstract = {Recent work on the structure of social networks and the internet has focused attention on graphs with
distributions of vertex degree that are significantly different from the Poisson degree distributions that have been widely studied in the past. In this paper we develop in detail the theory of random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions. In addition to simple undirected, unipartite graphs, we examine the properties of directed and bipartite graphs. Among other results, we derive exact expressions for the position of the phase transition at which a giant component first forms, the mean component size, the size of the giant component if there is one, the mean number of vertices a certain distance away from a randomly chosen vertex, and the average vertex-vertex distance within a graph. We apply our theory to some real-world graphs, including the worldwide web and collaboration graphs of scientists and Fortune 1000 company directors. We demonstrate that in some cases random graphs with appropriate distributions of vertex degree predict with surprising accuracy the behavior of the real world, while in others there is a measurable discrepancy between theory and reality, perhaps indicating the presence of additional social structure in the network that is not captured by the random graph.},

This body of work has generated simple yet powerful explanations for the epidemics of measles and chickenpox, while the dynamics of other infectious diseases, such as whooping cough, have proved more challenging to decipher. A number of authors have, in recent years, proposed that the noisy and somewhat irregular epidemics of whooping cough may arise due to stochasticity and its interaction with nonlinearity in transmission and seasonal variation in contact rates. The reason underlying the susceptibility of whooping cough dynamics to noise and the precise nature of its transient dynamics remain poorly understood. Here we use household data on the incubation period in order to parametrize more realistic distributions of the latent and infectious periods. We demonstrate that previously reported phenomena result from transients following the interaction between the stable annual attractor and unstable multiennial solutions.},

   Abstract = {Live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccines present new possibilities for the prevention and control of influenza. Administered intranasally, LAIV vaccines offer a needle-free route of administration. These investigational vaccines have also been shown to be safe and effective in children and healthy working adults. A 2-year place bo-con trolled trial among young children (1996-1997 and 1997-1998 influenza seasons) demonstrated that LAIV vaccine was associated with a 92% reduction in laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza. Vaccination also significantly reduced episodes of otitis media and antibiotic use. In a placebo-controlled trial among healthy working adults during the 1997-1998 season, LAIV vaccine significantly reduced episodes of febrile upper respiratory tract illness and illness- associated work loss. health-care use, and antibiotic use. Seventy percent of study participants self-administered the vaccine. An economic analysis of the benefits of LAIV vaccine in this population suggests that the break-even cost for LAIV vaccine and its administration for healthy working adults would be about $39. For both children and healthy adults. LAIV vaccine provided substantial protection during the 1997-1998 season when the predominant circulating virus, the A/Sydney variant, was not contained in the vaccine. Studies are still underway to evaluate the potential incremental benefits of LAIV vaccine in addition to inactivated vaccine in high-risk populations. LAIV vaccines will be an important addition to the armamentarium for fighting influenza. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

   Abstract = {Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a novel infectious disease with global impact. A virus from the family Coronaviridae has been identified as the cause, but the pathogenesis is still unclear. Methods Post-mortem tissue samples from six patients who died from SARS in February and March, 2003, and an open lung biopsy from one of these patients were studied by histology and virology. Only one full autopsy was done. Evidence of infection with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and human metapneumovirus was sought by reverse-transcriptase PCR and serology. Pathological samples were examined by light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Findings All six patients had serological evidence of recent infection with SARS-CoV. Diffuse alveolar damage was common but not universal. Morphological changes identified were bronchial epithelial denudation, loss of cilia, and squamous metaplasia. Secondary bacterial pneumonia was present in one case. A giant-cell infiltrate was seen in four patients, with a pronounced increase in macrophages in the alveoli and the interstitium of the lung. Haemophagocytosis was present in two patients. The alveolar pneumocytes also showed cytomegaly with granular amphophilic cytoplasm. The patient for whom full autopsy was done had atrophy of the white pulp of the spleen. Electron microscopy revealed viral particles in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells corresponding to coronavirus. Interpretation SARS is associated with epithelial-cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages in the lung. The presence of haemophagocytosis supports the contention that cytokine dysregulation may account, at least partly, for the severity of the clinical disease. The case definition of SARS should acknowledge the range of lung pathology associated with this disease.},

   Pages = {297-307},
   Abstract = {The reporting interval of infectious diseases is often determined as a time unit in the calendar regardless of the epidemiological characteristics of the disease. No guidelines have been proposed to choose the reporting interval of infectious diseases. The present study aims at translating coarsely reported epidemic data into the reproduction number and clarifying the ideal reporting interval to offer detailed insights into the time course of an epidemic. We briefly revisit the dispersibility ratio, i.e. ratio of cases in successive reporting intervals, proposed by Clare Oswald Stallybrass, detecting technical flaws in the historical studies. We derive a corrected expression for this quantity and propose simple algorithms to estimate the effective reproduction number as a function of time, adjusting the reporting interval to the generation time of a disease and demonstrating a clear relationship among the generation-time distribution, reporting interval and growth rate of an epidemic. Our exercise suggests that an ideal reporting interval is the mean generation time, so that the ratio of cases in successive intervals can yield the reproduction number. When it is impra- ctical to report observations every mean generation time, we also present an alternative method that enables us to obtain straightforward estimates of the reproduction number for any reporting interval that suits the practical purpose of infection control.},

   Journal = {Journal Of Theoretical Biology},
   Abstract = {Nishiura et al. (2006) recently reported the earliest explicit documentation of the basic reproduction number, R0, proposed by Dr. Theophil Lotz in 1880. Theoretical explanations by Dr. Lotz concerning the geometric increase in smallpox cases were highly successful, and his impressive description of herd immunity was most appropriate for his time (Lotz, 1880). In the present paper, we introduce two earlier studies to facilitate the discussion regarding the emergence of the concept of R0 in mathematical demography, where R0 is defined as the average number of offspring an individual in a population will produce in his/her lifetime. Although Theophil Lotz and Adolf Gottstein explicitly used R0 in describing the geometric progression of directly transmitted diseases in the late 19th century (Lotz, 1880; Gottstein, 1897), the concept of R0 in demography is believed to have emerged independently at a similar time (Böckh, 1886; Farr, 1880; Lewes, 1984; Dietz, 1993; Heesterbeek, 2002) and these two closely related measures remained unconnected until later researchers, most notably Alfred Lotka (1880–1949), discussed the mathematical theory in both fields (Sharpe and Lotka, 1911; Lotka, 1923; Heesterbeek, 2002). While the discussions of R0 in demography most likely started in the late 19th century, the relevant conceptual frameworks, which are useful for enhancing understanding of the emergence of R0, were conducted 50–100 years earlier by the French mathematicians Drs. Emmanuel-Etienne Duvillard (1755–1832) and Francis Corbaux (1769–1843).},

   Abstract = {Mathematical models of infectious diseases, which are in principle analytically tractable, use two general
approaches. The first approach, generally known as compartmental modeling, addresses the time evolution of
disease propagation at the expense of simplifying the pattern of transmission. The second approach uses
network theory to incorporate detailed information pertaining to the underlying contact structure among individuals
while disregarding the progression of time during outbreaks. So far, the only alternative that enables the
integration of both aspects of disease propagation simultaneously while preserving the variety of outcomes has
been to abandon the analytical approach and rely on computer simulations. We offer an analytical framework,
that incorporates both the complexity of contact network structure and the time progression of disease spread.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that this framework is equally effective on finite- and “infinite”-size networks.
This formalism can be equally applied to similar percolation phenomena on networks in other areas of science

   Pages = {71-83},
   Abstract = {Abstract:
The Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) is the dominant paradigm in predicting patch use and numerous tests support its qualitative predictions. Quantitative tests under complex foraging situations could be expected to be more variable in their support because the MVT assumes behavior maximizes only net energy-intake rate. However across a survey of 26 studies, foragers rather consistently "erred" in staying too long in patches. Such a consistent direction to the errors suggests that the simplifying assumptions of the MVT introduce a systematic bias rather than just imprecision. Therefore, I simulated patch use as a state-dependent response to physiological state, travel cost, predation risk, prey densities, and fitness currencies other than net-rate maximization (e.g., maximizing survival, reproductive investment, or mating opportunities). State-dependent behavior consistently results in longer patch residence times than predicted by the MVT or another foraging model, the minimize mu /g rule, and these rules fail to closely approximate the best behavioral strategy over a wide range of conditions. Because patch residence times increase with state-dependent behavior, this also predicts mass regulation below maximum energy capacities without direct mass-specific costs. Finally, qualitative behavioral predictions from the MVT about giving-up densities in patches and the effects of travel costs are often inconsistent with state-dependent behavior. Thus in order to accurately predict patch exploitation patterns, the model highlights the need to: (1) consider predator behavior (sit-and-wait versus actively foraging); (2) identify activities that can occur simultaneously to foraging (i.e., mate search or parental care); and (3) specify the range of nutritional states likely in foraging animals. Future predictive models of patch use should explicitly consider these parameters.},

   Number = {11},
   Pages = {1954-1962},
   Abstract = {The Delta 32 mutation at the CCR5 locus is a well-studied example of natural selection acting in humans. The mutation is found principally in Europe and western Asia, with higher frequencies generally in the north. Homozygous carriers of the Delta 32 mutation are resistant to HIV-1 infection because the mutation prevents functional expression of the CCR5 chemokine receptor normally used by HIV-1 to enter CD4+ T cells. HIV has emerged only recently, but population genetic data strongly suggest D32 has been under intense selection for much of its evolutionary history. To understand how selection and dispersal have interacted during the history of the D32 allele, we implemented a spatially explicit model of the spread of D32. The model includes the effects of sampling, which we show can give rise to local peaks in observed allele frequencies. In addition, we show that with modest gradients in selection intensity, the origin of the Delta 32 allele may be relatively far from the current areas of highest allele frequency. The geographic distribution of the Delta 32 allele is consistent with previous reports of a strong selective advantage (>10%) for Delta 32 carriers and of dispersal over relatively long distances (> 100 km/generation). When selection is assumed to be uniform across Europe and western Asia, we find support for a northern European origin and long-range dispersal consistent with the Viking-mediated dispersal of Delta 32 proposed by G. Lucotte and G. Mercier. However, when we allow for gradients in selection intensity, we estimate the origin to be outside of northern Europe and selection intensities to be strongest in the northwest. Our results describe the evolutionary history of the Delta 32 allele and establish a general methodology for studying the geographic distribution of selected alleles.},

   Abstract = {Cooperation is needed for evolution to construct new levels of organization. Genomes, cells, multicellular organisms, social insects, and human society are all based on cooperation. Cooperation means that selfish replicators forgo some of their reproductive potential to help one another. But natural selection implies competition and therefore opposes cooperation unless a specific mechanism is at work. Here I discuss five mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation: kin selection, direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, network reciprocity, and group selection. For each mechanism, a simple rule is derived that specifies whether natural selection can lead to cooperation.},

Discriminators provide help to those individuals who have provided help. Even if the help is never returned by the beneficiary, or by individuals who in turn have been helped by the beneficiary, discriminating altruism can be resistant against invasion by defectors. Indiscriminate altruists can invade by random drift, however, setting up a complex dynamical system. In certain situations, defectors can invade only if their invasion attempts are sufficiently rare. We also consider a model with incomplete information and obtain conditions for the stability of altruism which differ from Hamilton's rule by simply replacing relatedness with acquaintanceship.

   Abstract = {Darwinian evolution has to provide an explanation for cooperative behaviour. Theories of cooperation are based on kin selection (dependent on genetic relatedness)(1,2), group selection(3-5) and reciprocal altruism(6-9). The idea of reciprocal altruism usually involves direct reciprocity: repeated encounters between the same individuals allow for the return of an altruistic act by the recipient(10-16). Here we present a new theoretical framework, which is based on indirect reciprocity(17) and does not require the same two individuals ever to meet again, individual selection can nevertheless favour cooperative strategies directed towards recipients that have helped others in the past. Cooperation pays because it confers the image of a valuable community member to the cooperating individual. We present computer simulations and analytic models that specify the conditions required for evolutionary stability(18) of indirect reciprocity. We show that the probability of knowing the 'image' of the recipient must exceed the cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act. We propose that the emergence of indirect reciprocity was a decisive step for the evolution of human societies.},

   Abstract = {The effect of the 1918 influenza pandemic on other diseases is a neglected topic in historical epidemiology. This paper takes up the hypothesis that the influenza pandemic affected the long-term decline of tuberculosis through selective mortality, such that many people with tuberculosis were killed in 1918, depressing subsequent tuberculosis mortality and transmission. Regularly collected vital statistics data on mortality of influenza and tuberculosis in the US are presented and analyzed demographically. The available population-level data fail to contradict the selection hypothesis. More work is needed to understand fully the role of multiple morbidities in the 1918 influenza pandemic. },

issue in ecology, and in this article we focus on one of the most widely studied spatial 
biodiversity patterns: the species–area relationship (SAR). The SAR is a central tool in 
conservation, being used to predict species loss following global climate change, and is 
striking in its universality throughout different geographical regions and across the tree 
of life. In this article we draw upon the methods of quantum ﬁeld theory and the 
foundation of neutral community ecology to derive the ﬁrst spatially explicit neutral 
prediction for the SAR. We ﬁnd that the SAR has three phases, with a power law 
increase at intermediate scales, consistent with decades of documented empirical 
patterns. Our model also provides a building block for incorporating non-neutral 
biological variation, with the potential to bridge the gap between neutral and niche-based 
approaches to community assembly.},

Using the seasonally forced SIR epidemic model, we are able to provide new insights into the dynamics of recurrent diseases and, in some cases, specific predictions about individual outbreaks. The analysis reveals a new threshold effect that gives clear conditions for the triggering of future disease outbreaks or their absence. The threshold depends critically on the susceptibility S0 of the population after an outbreak. We show that in the presence of seasonality, forecasts based on the susceptibility S0 are more reliable than those based on the classical reproductive number R0 from the conventional theory.},

   Abstract = {Background The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread rapidly around the world, largely because persons infected with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) traveled on aircraft to distant cities. Although many infected persons traveled on commercial aircraft, the risk, if any, of in-flight transmission is unknown.  Methods We attempted to interview passengers and crew members at least 10 days after they had taken one of three flights that transported a patient or patients with SARS. All index patients met the criteria of the World Health Organization for a probable case of SARS, and index or secondary cases were confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or serologic testing.  Results After one flight carrying a symptomatic person and 119 other persons, laboratory-confirmed SARS developed in 16 persons, 2 others were given diagnoses of probable SARS, and 4 were reported to have SARS but could not be interviewed. Among the 22 persons with illness, the mean time from the flight to the onset of symptoms was four days (range, two to eight), and there were no recognized exposures to patients with SARS before or after the flight. Illness in passengers was related to the physical proximity to the index patient, with illness reported in 8 of the 23 persons who were seated in the three rows in front of the index patient, as compared with 10 of the 88 persons who were seated elsewhere (relative risk, 3.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 6.9). In contrast, another flight carrying four symptomatic persons resulted in transmission to at most one other person, and no illness was documented in passengers on the flight that carried a person who had presymptomatic SARS.  Conclusions Transmission of SARS may occur on an aircraft when infected persons fly during the symptomatic phase of illness. Measures to reduce the risk of transmission are warranted.},

Using routinely collected monthly age-stratified mortality data, we show that an unmistakable shift in the age distribution of epidemic deaths occurred during the 1917/1918 influenza season in New York City. The timing, magnitude, and age distribution of this mortality shift provide strong evidence that an early wave of the pandemic virus was present in New York City during February-April 1918.},

   Volume = {216},

   Abstract = {Optimization of antibody affinity is a hallmark of the humoral immune response. It takes place in hundreds of transient microstructures called germinal centers (GCs). Their function and time-dependent behavior are subjects of active investigation. According to a generally accepted notion, their individual kinetics follows the average kinetics of all GCs present in the observed lymphatic tissue. In this review, we challenge this view and point out, with the help of mathematical simulations, that inferring the kinetics of individual GCs from cross-sectional evaluation of GC kinetics is virtually impossible. Thus, the time course of individual GCs is open to conjecture. For instance, one possible interpretation is that GCs exist for a time span considerably shorter than that of the observed average kinetics. We explore the implications of different temporal organizations of GCs in the light of the hypothesis that GC B-cell emigrants recolonize GC niches. This assumption leads to a view where GCs work in parallel but are linked by recirculation of B-cell emigrants. In this view, interleaved global and local competition provide for an implementation of multiple levels of B-cell selection in affinity maturation. The concepts of iteration, all-or-none behavior, and phasic mutation schedule are discussed in the light of this hypothesis.},

To control the epidemic, public health officials initiated enhanced surveillance, isolation of SARS patients, use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by health-care workers, and quarantine of contacts of known SARS patients. Approximately 30,000 Beijing residents were quarantined in their homes or quarantine sites. To guide future quarantine policy, the Chinese Field Epidemiology Training Program (China FETP) of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) conducted a survey to estimate the risk for acquiring SARS among quarantined residents of Haidian District (2001 population: 2.24 million), Beijing, in May 2003, 1 month after the epidemic peaked. This report summarizes the results of that survey, which indicate that, as a component of a comprehensive SARS-control program, quarantine should be limited to persons who have contact with an actively ill SARS patient in the home or hospital, allowing for better focus of resources in future outbreaks.},

   Pages = {119-133},
   Abstract = {Influenza A virus initiated worldwide epidemics (pandemics) in 1918, 1957, 1968 and 1977. A revised calculation of the 1918- 1919 pandemic estimates that 40 million persons died and 500 million were infected. The mortalities in 1957 and 1968 were nearly 6 million. Biological and genetic characteristics of the causative agents of the more recent pandemics, have been well studied but little is known about the causative agent of the Great Pandemic in 1918. Genetic characterisation of the 1918 virus has been achieved by sourcing virus RNA from formalin fixed lung samples or by exhuming frozen victims of the outbreak from Arctic regions. Initial analysis of the HA gene from two USA sources indicates a virus related to swine and human influenza with no base insertion at the HA1-HA2 cleavage junction which, at least in avian influenza A, characterises high virulence. Important unanswered questions are whether the 1918 virus spread pantropically perhaps to include the brain and hence cause encephalitis including the later lethargic forms, or whether infection was confined to the respiratory tract. Re-examination of reports of respiratory disease in England and France in 1916-1917 may indicate a non-Spanish origin of the pandemic and a period of 2 years for the virus to be seeded worldwide. In contrast the other two pandemic viruses in 1957 and 1968 appeared to originate in Asia. New anti- neuraminidase drugs in conjunction with amantadine and novel developments with influenza vaccines would be expected to ameliorate the disease in a future pandemic.

We argue that there is a shared reluctance to move away from a narrow variable-based thinking that pervades both disciplines, and a tendency to reify the multivariate linear procedures employed in both disciplines. In particular, we concentrate on the difficulties generated by classical variable-based approaches that are especially striking when one neglects selection processes and the use of strategies to minimize its effects. We illustrate these difficulties in terms of the so-called "Hispanic Paradox", which refers to comparative health advantages that some Hispanic groups appear to have. We find that much of what is conceived by demographers and epidemiologists as a paradox may not be paradoxical at all.},

   Abstract = {Diverse and complex microbial ecosystems are found in virtually every environment on earth, yet we know very little about their composition and ecology. Comprehensive identification and quantification of the constituents of these microbial communities-a 'census'-is an essential foundation for understanding their biology. To address this problem, we developed, tested and optimized a DNA oligonucleotide microarray composed of 10 462 small subunit (SSU) ribosomal DNA (rDNA) probes (7167 unique sequences) selected to provide quantitative information on the taxonomic composition of diverse microbial populations. Using our optimized experimental approach, this microarray enabled detection and quantification of individual bacterial species present at fractional abundances of < 0.1% in complex synthetic mixtures. The estimates of bacterial species abundance obtained using this microarray are similar to those obtained by phylogenetic analysis of SSU rDNA sequences from the same samples-the current 'gold standard' method for profiling microbial communities. Furthermore, probes designed to represent higher order taxonomic groups of bacterial species reliably detected microbes for which there were no species-specific probes. This simple, rapid microarray procedure can be used to explore and systematically characterize complex microbial communities, such as those found within the human body.},

This instability exists even when the system is stable to $m=0$ axisymmetric modes.  We prove this result first using a WKB analysis and then show how criteria for the unstable mode to occur may be found using a global analysis.  We prove that the instability exists when the Toomre parameter $Q>1$, but as $Q$ increases further, the mode is stabilized.  We also give a simple physical description of the mode.  This analysis shows that highly flattened axisymmetric systems, with little or no net rotation are unstable to these $m=1$ modes.  If the number of retrograde stars is reduced, the mode becomes overstable, and according to WKB analysis, in the absence of any retrograde stars, the mode ceases to occur for $Q>1$.},

   Journal = {Journal of Biogeography},
   Volume = {31},
   Pages = {269-275},
   Abstract = {Aim This paper examines the possibility that bubonic plague was a disease endemic in the wild rodent population of Egypt and East Africa.
Location The study focuses on Egypt and the Nile Valley during the Pharaonic period.
Methods This paper presents a hypothesis based on archaeoentomological, archaeozoological and biogeographical information on the insect and small mammal species involved in the spread of plague, as well as relevant information from early literary sources.
Results The primary host for the rat flea Xenopsylla cheopis is the Nile rat, Arvicanthis niloticus. Urbanization and the Nile floods brought into contact humans and the Nile rat and its ectoparasite, Xenopsylla cheopis, which was able to move to a newly introduced host the synanthropic Rattus rattus. The existence of large numbers of human fleas and squalid conditions from the Workmens' Village at Amarna, evidence for nile rats and black rats from Pharaonic sites and descriptions of an epidemic disease in the Amarna letters, the Hittitic archives and the Ebers papyrus with references to swelling buboes, present a new scenario for the origins of the disease.
Main conclusions Most modern researchers have regarded the origins of bubonic plague as a disease of Central Asiatic rodents. Here, I examine the evidence for plague in Egypt, and suggest that the bacillus Yersinia pestis was primarily a disease of the Nile rat, Arvicanthis niloticus, which only achieved epidemic proportions when its vector, the tropical rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, was able to make the jump to a new host, the black or ship rat, Rattus rattus, introduced from India or indirectly via Mesopotamia during the Pharaonic period. Synanthropy and a high death rate in the new host lead to frequent transfer to human populations and stochastic waves of pandemics.},

   Abstract = {Three sperm competition games against relatives are examined. In the first, a male has no information at the time of mating as to whether or not his ejaculate will face sperm competition from a related or unrelated male. Sperm expenditure increases with overall sperm competition risk q and declines with the probability p that the competitor shares the same allele for sperm expenditure. In the second game, males have almost perfect information: they 'know' whether there will be sperm competition and, if so, whether this involves a related or unrelated male. Sperm expenditure is reduced by a factor rho when competing with a relative. In the third game, males 'know' when they compete with relatives, but have no information for other matings whether they will face sperm competition from unrelated males. A male without information expends less on his ejaculate than a male competing with a close relative if the overall risk of sperm competition is low, but more if the overall risk is high. The average relative ejaculate expenditure is the same in all three games so that, if this determines testis size, data is required only on the overall sperm competition risk, the probability of competing with a relative and the average p in order to perform comparative analyses.},

   Journal = {Proceedings Of The Royal Society Of London Series B-Biological Sciences},
   Volume = {242},
   Number = {1304},
   Pages = {127-133},
   Abstract = {This paper examines ejaculation strategies for cases when an opportunist male `steals' a mating with the female of a paired male. This is an evolutionary game of competitive ejaculation in which two (or more) males mate with the same female. Prospective evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) models are analysed which seek ESS sperm numbers. Sperm competition is assumed to obey the `raffle principle' (i.e. fertilization probability increases with the proportion of a given male's sperm in the female tract). The models assume a trade-off between sperm expenditure and other aspects of reproductive success. Sperm costs may be unequal for the two males (paired male; opportunist male), especially if given phenotypes tend to adopt one or other pattern. In the `sneaks and guarders' (SG) game, certain males (guarders) are paired permanently to particular females, and others (sneaks) obtain matings opportunistically. Roles are therefore constant. Guarders are assumed to have no information whether a sneak mating has occurred (their strategy is tuned to the average risk of sperm competition) and the sperm costs are assumed to be unequal for sneaks and guarders. If sneak matings are rare, guarding males should spend less effort on ejaculates than sneaks. But if sneak matings are frequent, and if the marginal cost of sperm is very low for sneaks, the guarder may expend the greater effort on sperm. If sperm are relatively very cheap for guarders, then in cases of double mating, the paternity prospects of guarders should be higher than for sneaks; otherwise sneaks should win. However, if a guarder detects a sneak mating, he should increase his sperm dose in the female tract and achieve higher fertilization prospects (paternity) than the sneak. A second model concerns cases of extra pair copulations (EPCS) where all males are paired to females, but all will mate with another male's female if the opportunity should arise. Thus roles are assigned randomly with fixed probability. In this game, sperm costs relate to reduced paternal care (or to other losses with the `primary' female) and are assumed to be equal to all males. Predictions are very similar to the sneaks--guarders game: when performing an EPC a male should expend more effort on sperm (and hence gain higher paternity) than when mating as a paired males, unless the EPC is detected, in which case a paired male should greatly increase his sperm dose in the female (and hence should predominate at fertilization).},

Qualitatively similar patterns emerge from analyses based on antigenic distance and from a published human influenza study. Combination of the equine data and epidemiological models allows us to calculate the effective reproductive number of transmission as a function of relevant genetic change in the virus, illuminating the probability of influenza epidemics as a function of immunity.},

   Journal = {Physical Review E},
   Volume = {65},
   Number = {3},
   Abstract = {Many real networks present a bounded scale-free behavior with a connectivity cutoff due to physical constraints or a finite network size. We study epidemic dynamics in bounded scale-free networks with soft and hard connectivity cutoffs. The finite size effects introduced by the cutoff induce an epidemic threshold that approaches zero at increasing sizes. The induced epidemic threshold is very small even at a relatively small cutoff, showing that the neglection of connectivity fluctuations in bounded scale-free networks leads to a strong overestimation of the epidemic threshold. We provide the expression for the infection prevalence and discuss its finite size corrections. The present paper shows that the highly heterogeneous nature of scale-free networks does not allow the use of homogeneous approximations even for systems of a relatively small number of nodes.},

   Pages = {193-196},
   Abstract = {A better understanding of transmission dynamics is essential in influenza pandemic planning. If a substantial proportion of transmissions were to occur during the presymptomatic phase or from asymptomatic individuals, then infection control measures such as contact tracing and quarantine of exposures would be of limited value. Infectiousness has been inferred based on the presence of influenza in the upper respiratory tract rather than from transmission experiments. Although asymptomatic individuals may shed influenza virus, studies have not determined if such people effectively transmit influenza. We performed a systematic review of published studies describing the relationship between viral shedding and disease transmission. Based on the available literature, we found that there is scant, if any, evidence that asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals play an important role in influenza transmission. As such, recent articles concerning pandemic planning, some using transmission modeling, may have overestimated the effect of presymptomatic or asymptomatic influenza transmission. More definitive transmission studies are sorely needed.},

   Abstract = {The regional malaria epidemics of the early 1900s provided the basis for much of our current understanding of malaria epidemiology. Colonel Gill, an eminent malariologist of that time, suggested that the explosive nature of the regional epidemics was due to a sudden increased infectiousness of the adult population. His pertinent observations underlying this suggestion have, however, gone unheeded. Here, the literature on Plasmodium seasonal behaviour is reviewed and three historical data sets, concerning seasonal transmission of Plasmodium falciparum, are examined. It is proposed that the dramatic seasonal increase in the density of uninfected mosquito bites results in an increased infectiousness of the human reservoir of infection and, therefore, plays a key role in "kick-starting" malaria parasite transmission.},

Methods We analysed case notes and microbiological findings for 50 patients with SARS, representing more than five separate epidemiologically linked transmission clusters. We defined the clinical presentation and risk factors associated with severe disease and investigated the causal agents by chest radiography and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and sera samples. We compared the laboratory findings with those submitted for microbiological investigation of other diseases from patients whose identity was masked. Findings Patients, age ranged from 23 to 74 years. Fever, chills, myalgia, and cough were the most frequent complaints. When compared with chest radiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were disproportionally mild. Patients who were household contacts of other infected people and had older age, lymphopenia, and liver dysfunction were associated with severe disease. A virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae was isolated from two patients. By use of serological and reverse- transcriptase PCR specific for this virus, 45 of 50 patients with SARS, but no controls, had evidence of infection with this virus. Interpretation A coronavirus was isolated from patients with SARS that might be the primary agent associated with this disease. Serological and molecular tests specific for the virus permitted a definitive laboratory diagnosis to be made and allowed further investigation to define whether other cofactors play a part in disease progression.},

   Abstract = {Background We investigated the temporal progression of the clinical, radiological, and virological changes in a community outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Methods We followed up 75 patients for 3 weeks managed with a standard treatment protocol of ribavirin and corticosteroids, and assessed the, pattern of clinical disease, viral load, risk factors for poor clinical outcome, and the usefulness of virological diagnostic methods. Findings Fever and pneumonia initially improved but 64 (85%) patients developed recurrent fever after a mean of 8-9 (SD 3.1) days, 55 (73%) had watery diarrhoea after 7.5 (2.3) days, 60 (80%) had radiological worsening after 7.4 (2.2) days, and respiratory symptoms worsened in 34 (45%) after 8.6 (3.0) days. In 34 (45%) patients, improvement of initial pulmonary lesions was associated with appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites. Nine (12%) patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 15 (20%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in week 3. Quantitative reverse- transcriptase (RT) PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates in 14 patients (four with ARDS) showed peak viral load at day 10, and at day 15 a load lower than at admission. Age and chronic hepatitis B virus infection treated with lamivudine were independent significant risk factors for progression to ARDS (p=0.001). SARS-associated coronavirus in faeces was seen on RT-PCR in 65 (97%) of 67 patients at day 14. The mean time to seroconversion was 20 days. Interpretation The consistent clinical progression, shifting radiological infiltrates, and an inverted V viral-load profile suggest that worsening in week 2 is unrelated to uncontrolled viral replication but may be related to immunopathological damage.},

   Pages = {5601-5605},
   Abstract = {The emergence of antibiotic resistance among nosocomial pathogens has reemphasized the need for effective infection control strategies. The spread of resistant pathogens within hospital settings proceeds along various routes of transmission and is characterized by large fluctuations in prevalence, which are typical for small populations, Identification of the most important route of colonization (exogenous by cross-transmission or endogenous caused by the selective pressure of antibiotics) is important for the design of optimal infection control strategies. Such identification can be based on a combination of epidemiological surveillance and costly and laborious as well as time-consuming methods of genotyping. Furthermore, analysis of the effects of interventions is hampered by the natural fluctuations in prevalence. To overcome these problems, we introduce a mathematical algorithm based on a Markov chain description. The input is longitudinal prevalence data only. The output is estimates of the key parameters characterizing the two colonization routes. The algorithm is tested on two longitudinal surveillance data sets of intensive care patients. The quality of the estimates is determined by comparing them to accurate estimates based on additional information obtained by genotyping. The results warrant optimism that this algorithm may help to quantify transmission dynamics and can be used to evaluate the effects of infection control interventions more carefully.},

   Pages = {258--265},
   Abstract = {A stability criterion is obtained starting from Vlasov's collision-free kinetic equations.  Possible instabilities propagating parallel to an arbitrary unit vector $\bf e$ are related to a function $F(u) \equiv \sum_j \omega_j^2 \int d^3{\bf v}\, g_j({\bf v})\, \delta({\bf e \dot v} - u)$, where $g_j({\bf v})$ is the normalized unperturbed distribution function and $\omega_j \equiv (4\pi n_j e_j^2/m_j)^{1/2}$ the plasma frequency, for the $j$th type of particle.  By using a method related to the Nyquist criterion, it is shown that plasma oscillations growing exponentially with time are possible if and only if $F(u)$ has a minimum at a value $u = \xi$ such that $\int_{-infty}^\infty du\,(u - \xi)^{-2}[F(u)-F(\xi)] > 0$.  A study of the initial value problem confirms that the plasma is normally stable if no exponentially growing modes exist;  but there is an exceptional class of distribution functions (recognizable by means of an extension of the above criterion) for which linearized stability theory breaks down.  The method is applied to several examples, of which the most important is a model of a current-carrying plasma with Maxwell distributions at different temperatrues for electrons and ions.  The meaning of the mathematical assumptions made is carefully discussed.},

   Abstract = {Researchers designing antitumor treatments have long focused on eliciting tumor-speciﬁc CD8 cytotoxic T lympho- 
cytes (CTL) because of their potent killing activity and their ability to reject transplanted organs. The resulting treatments, 
however, have generally been surprisingly poor at inducing complete tumor rejection, both in experimental models 
and in the clinic. Although a few scattered studies suggested that CD4 T “helper” cells might also serve as antitumor effec- 
tors, they have generally been studied mostly for their ability to enhance the activity of CTL. In this mouse study, we 
compared monoclonal populations of tumor-speciﬁc CD4 and CD8 T cells as effectors against several different tumors, and found that CD4 T cells eliminated tumors that were resistant to CD8-mediated rejection, even in cases where the tumors expressed major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules but not MHC class II. MHC class II expression on host tissues was critical, suggesting that the CD4 T cells act indirectly. Indeed, the CD4 T cells partnered with NK cells to obtain the maximal antitumor 
effect. These ﬁndings suggest that CD4 T cells can be powerful antitumor effector cells that can, in some cases, outperform 
CD8 T cells, which are the current “gold standard” effector cell in tumor immunotherapy. (Blood. 2007;109:5346-5354) },

   Pages = {188-191},
   Abstract = {Analysis of changes in viral load after initiation of treatment with potent antiretroviral agents has provided substantial insight into the dynamics of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The concentration of HIV-1 in plasma drops by approximately 99% in the first two weeks of treatment owing to the rapid elimination of free virus with a half-life (t1/2) of < or =6 hours and loss of productively infected cells with a t1/2 of 1.6 days. Here we show that with combination therapy this initial decrease is followed by a slower second-phase decay of plasma viraemia. Detailed mathematical analysis shows that the loss of long-lived infected cells (t1/2 of 1-4 weeks) is a major contributor to the second phase, whereas the activation of latently infected lymphocytes (t1/2 of 0.5-2 weeks) is only a minor source. Based on these decay characteristics, we estimate that 2.3-3.1 years of a completely inhibitory treatment would be required to eliminate HIV-1 from these compartments. To eradicate HIV-1 completely, even longer treatment may be needed because of the possible existence of undetected viral compartments or sanctuary sites.},

Performing complex tasks such as learning and memory involves cooperation among large numbers of components of the immune system and hence there is interest in using methods and concepts from statistical physics. Furthermore, the immune response develops in time and the description of its time evolution is an interesting problem in dynamical systems.

We propose that the matrix within which habitat fragments occur is of equal importance and focus on quality of the matrix as an interesting variable. We studied ground-foraging ants in isolated montane forest fragments in the matrix of coffee agroecosystems of southwestern Chiapas, Mexico. We sampled the ants, with tuna fish as bait, in plots at various distances from a forest fragment (2-750 m) on two farms, one an organic farm with considerable shade, the other a conventional farm with only spotty shade. Each plot contained a grid of 49 (7 x 7) or 100 (10 x 10) baits. The species richness of ground-foraging ants was not significantly different between the forest fragment and the high-quality matrix, but it was significantly lower in the low-quality matrix than in the forest. Furthermore, species richness decreased with distance from the forest fragment in both matrix types. However, the rate of decrease in species richness was greater in the conventional farm (poor-quality matrix) than in the organic farm (high-quality matrix), suggesting that the quality of the agricultural matrix is important for the conservation of ant diversity.},

   Pages = {245-18},
   Abstract = {Approximate entropy (ApEn) is a recently formulated family of parameters and statistics quantifying regularity (orderliness) in serial data, with developments within theoretical mathematics as well as numerous applications to multiple biological contexts. We discuss the motivation for ApEn development, from the study of inappropriate application of dynamical systems (complexity) algorithms to general time-series settings. ApEn is scale invariant and model independent, evaluates both dominant and subordinant patterns in data, and discriminates series for which clear feature recognition is difficult. ApEn is applicable to systems with at least 50 data points and to broad classes of models: it can be applied to discriminate both general classes of correlated stochastic processes, as well as noisy deterministic systems. Moreover, ApEn is complementary to spectral and autocorrelation analyses, providing effective discriminatory capability in instances in which the aforementioned measures exhibit minimal distinctions. Representative ApEn applications to human aging studies, based on both heart rate and endocrinologic (hormonal secretory) time series, are featured. Heart rate (HR) studies include gender- and age-related changes in HR dynamics in older subjects, and analyses of "near-SIDS" infants. Endocrinologic applications establish clear quantitative changes in joint LH-testosterone secretory dynamics in older versus younger men (a "partial male menopause"), via cross-ApEn, a related two-variable asynchrony formulation; a disruption in LH-FSH-NPT (penile tumescence) synchrony in older subjects; and changes in LH-FSH secretory dynamics across menopause. The capability of ApEn to assess relatively subtle disruptions, typically found earlier in the history of a subject than mean and variance changes, holds the potential for enhanced preventative and earlier interventionist strategies.},

   Abstract = {In birds, the time immediately after oviposition has been assumed to be particularly favourable for an insemination to fertilize eggs. Based on this assumption, Thornhill (1988, Verhandlungen der Deutschen Zoologischten Gesellschaft, 81, 145-154) suggested that a particular vocalization, the postoviposition cackle, of female fowl, Gallus gallus, signalled a peak in fertility, which incited male sexual behaviour and resulted in females copulating with the most dominant males. It may therefore benefit females by indirectly selecting for competitive copulation partners. We tested this hypothesis in a free-ranging population of feral fowl. Contrary to the hypothesis, we found that: (1) postoviposition cackling was associated with a significantly lower probability of a female obtaining a copulation; and (2) males did not respond any differently to the experimental playback of the postoviposition cackling and a control call. These results are consistent with the period immediately after oviposition being an unfavourable time for an insemination to fertilize eggs. One function of postoviposition cackling may thus be to avoid the costs of sexual harassment by signalling to males a particularly unsuitable time for fertilization.

   Abstract = {Study Objectives. To determine whether antipyretic therapy prolongs the course of experimental influenza A, Shigella sonnei, and Rickettsia rickettsii infections.
Design. Retrospective observational study.
Setting. University Center for Vaccine Development.
Subjects. Fifty-four volunteers with experimentally induced influenza A, 45 with S. sonnei, and 21 with R. rickettsii infections participated.
Interventions. Subjects from the six influenza A studies were challenged intranasally. If they met certain criteria, they were offered aspirin or acetaminophen for symptomatic relief. Subjects from the three Shigella studies were challenged with the bacteria and then given trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. Acetaminophen also could be administered. In the one R. rickettsii trial, subjects were inoculated intradermally and treated with tetracycline. Again, acetaminophen was administered for symptomatic relief.
Measurements and Main Results. Data, excerpted from subjects' study records, were evaluated using Wilcoxon tests, Spearman's correlation coefficients, and multiple regression analysis. Two-tailed hypotheses with a p value of 0.05 were used for all of the analyses. There was a striking correlation between antipyretic therapy and duration of illness in subjects infected with influenza A and S. sonnei, but not R. rickettsii.
Conclusions. Multivariate analysis suggested that antipyretic therapy prolonged illness in subjects infected with influenza A, but its use was the result of prolonged illness in those infected with S. sonnei. The precise nature of these relationships requires a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.},

   Abstract = {Most animals that once lived have gone extinct. The remains of a few of these can be found in museum collections worldwide. As modern evolutionary biology is limited to the use of extant taxa, retrieving DNA from extinct or subfossil organisms can add significant insight into past population history and resolve phylogenies that can be tentative by morphology alone. DNA is a relatively weak molecule, comparatively speaking, yet under certain conditions it persists in the fossil record, despite what in vitro chemistry predicts. While most fossil remains do not contain DNA, museum specimens can be screened for the presence of conditions that would be conducive for nucleic acid preservation by measuring the extent of amino acid racemization and by looking at the extent of protein hydrolysis by pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Results from these types of analyses suggest that the preservation of DNA is linked to the temperature and its constancy at a site rather than its age. Chemical analyses of coprolites from extinct herbivores from the late Pleistocene, as well as Archaic Native Americans, show the presence of compounds from the Maillard reaction. Upon the cleaving of these products, the defecator can be identified and his diet analyzed.},

Furthermore, amplification of chloroplast DNA sequences identified eight different plants as dietary elements. These archaic humans consumed 2-4 different animal species and 4-8 different plant species during a short time period, The success rate for retrieval of DNA from paleofeces is in strong contrast to that from skeletal remains where the success rate is generally low. Thus, human paleofecal remains represent a source of ancient DNA that significantly complements and may in some cases be superior to that from skeletal tissue.},

The "OPV/AIDS hypothesis" suggests that the OBV used in this campaign was produced in chimpanzee kidney epithelial cell cultures rather than in monkey kidney cell cultures, as stated by H. Koprowski and co-workers, who produced the OPV. If chimpanzee cells were indeed used, this would lend support to the OPV/AIDS hypothesis, since chimpanzees harbor a simian immunodeficiency virus, widely accepted to be the origin of HIV-1. We analyzed several early OPV pools and found no evidence for the presence of chimpanzee DNA; by contrast, monkey DNA is present.},

   Abstract = {We study how spontaneous reduction in the number of contacts could develop, as a defensive response, during an epidemic and affect the course of infection events. A model is proposed which couples an SIR model with selection of behaviours driven by imitation dynamics. Therefore, infection transmission and population behaviour become dynamical variables that influence each other. In particular, time scales of behavioural changes and epidemic transmission can be different. We provide a full qualitative characterization of the solutions when the dynamics of behavioural changes is either much faster or much slower than that of epidemic transmission. The model accounts for multiple outbreaks occurring within the same epidemic episode. Moreover, the model can explain "asymmetric waves", i.e., infection waves whose rising and decaying phases differ in slope. Finally, we prove that introduction of behavioural dynamics results in the reduction of the final attack rate. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Abstract = {According to ecological theory, populations whose dynamics are entrained by environmental correlation face increased extinction risk as environmental conditions become more synchronized spatially. This prediction is highly relevant to the study of ecological consequences of climate change. Recent empirical studies have indicated, for example, that large-scale climate synchronizes trophic interactions and population dynamics over broad spatial scales in freshwater and terrestrial systems. Here, we present an analysis of century-scale, spatially replicated data on local weather and the population dynamics of caribou in Greenland. Our results indicate that spatial autocorrelation in local weather has increased with large-scale climatic warming. This increase in spatial synchrony of environmental conditions has been matched, in turn, by an increase in the spatial synchrony of local caribou populations toward the end of the 20th century. Our results indicate that spatial synchrony in environmental conditions and the populations influenced by them are highly variable through time and can increase with climatic warming. We suggest that if future warming can increase population synchrony, it may also increase extinction risk.},

   Abstract = {BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a condition of unknown cause that has recently been recognized in patients in Asia, North America, and Europe. This report summarizes the initial epidemiologic findings, clinical description, and diagnostic findings that followed the identification of SARS in Canada. METHODS SARS was first identified in Canada in early March 2003. We collected epidemiologic, clinical, and diagnostic data from each of the first 10 cases prospectively as they were identified. Specimens from all cases were sent to local, provincial, national, and international laboratories for studies to identify an etiologic agent. RESULTS The patients ranged from 24 to 78 years old; 60 percent were men. Transmission occurred only after close contact. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (in 100 percent of cases) and malaise (in 70 percent), followed by nonproductive cough (in 100 percent) and dyspnea (in 80 percent) associated with infiltrates on chest radiography (in 100 percent). Lymphopenia (in 89 percent of those for whom data were available), elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (in 80 percent), elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels (in 78 percent), and elevated creatinine kinase levels (in 56 percent) were common. Empirical therapy most commonly included antibiotics, oseltamivir, and intravenous ribavirin. Mechanical ventilation was required in five patients. Three patients died, and five have had clinical improvement. The results of laboratory investigations were negative or not clinically significant except for the amplification of human metapneumovirus from respiratory specimens from five of nine patients and the isolation and amplification of a novel coronavirus from five of nine patients. In four cases both pathogens were isolated. CONCLUSIONS SARS is a condition associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. It appears to be of viral origin, with patterns suggesting droplet or contact transmission. The role of human metapneumovirus, a novel coronavirus, or both requires further investigation.},

Conventional microbiology, bacterial population genetics, and genome sequence data, all suggest that Y pestis is a recently evolved clone of the enteric pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. The genetic basis of this organism's rapid adaptation to its insect vector (the flea) with transmission between mammalian hosts by novel subcutaneous and pneumonic routes of infection is becoming clearer. This transition provides a paradigm for the way in which new pathogens could emerge. Plague in humans is controlled by suppression of rodent reservoir hosts and their fleas and by early detection and treatment of cases of disease. Detection systems for plague in non-endemic regions might now be needed because of a bioterrorism threat. Rapid diagnostic tests are available and a subunit vaccine is in clinical trials.},

   Volume = {20},

   Abstract = {The ability of the immune system to effectively respond to human tumours is a matter of long-term controversy. 
There is an increasing body of recent evidence to support a role for the immune system in eliminating pre-clinical 
cancers, an old concept termed ‘immunosurveillance’. ‘Immunoediting’ is an updated hypothesis, in which selection 
pressures applied by the immune response to tumours modulate tumour immunogenicity and growth. Tumour 
inﬁltration by immune cells has been shown to have powerful prognostic signiﬁcance in a host of cancer types. 
Paradoxically, in some circumstances the immune system can promote tumour development. Cytotoxic therapies, 
including radiotherapy and chemotherapy, induce potentially immunogenic cell death, releasing tumour-associated 
antigens in the context of a ‘danger’ signal to the immune system. An understanding of the interaction between 
immune cells, tumour cells and treatment modalities will therefore guide the future combination of immunotherapy 
with conventional therapy to achieve optimal anti-tumour effects.},

   Volume = {269},
   Number = {1507},
   Pages = {2291-2299},
   Abstract = {The hypothesis that females prefer older males because they have higher mean fitness than younger males has been the centre of recent controversy. These discussions have focused on the success of a female who prefers males of a particular age class when age cues, but not quality cues, are available. Thus, if the distribution of male quality changes with age, such that older males have on average genotypes with higher fitness than younger males, then a female who mates with older males has fitter offspring, which allows the female preference to spread through a genetic correlation. We develop a general model for male display in a species with multiple reproductive bouts that allows us to identify the conditions that promote reliable signalling within an age class. Because males have opportunities for future reproduction, they will reduce their levels of advertising compared with a semelparous species. In addition, because higher-quality males have more future reproduction,!   they will reduce their advertising more than low- quality males. Thus, the conditions for reliable signalling in a semelparous organism are generally not sufficient to produce reliable signalling in species with multiple reproductive bouts. This result is due to the possibility of future reproduction so that, as individuals age and the opportunities for future reproduction fade, signalling becomes more reliable. This provides a novel rationale for female preference for older mates; older males reveal more information in their sexual displays.},

   Abstract = {The geometric mean of fitness is considered to be the main indicator of evolutionary change in stochastic models. However, this measure was initially derived for models with infinite population sizes, where the long-term evolu- tionary behavior can be described with certainty. In this paper we begin an exploration of the limitations and util- ity of this approach to evolution in finite populations and discuss alternate methods for predicting evolutionary dynamics. We reanalyze a model of lottery competition under environmental stochasticity by including popula- tion finiteness, and show that the geometric mean predictions do not always agree with those based on the fixa- tion probability of rare alleles. Further, the fixation probability can be inserted into adaptive dynamics equations to derive the mean state of the population. We explore the effects of increasing population size on these conclu- sions through simulations. These simulations show that for small population sizes the fixation probability accu- rately predicts the course of evolution, but as population size becomes large the geometric mean predictions are  upheld. The two approaches are reconciled because the time scale on which the fixation probability approach ap- plies becomes very large as population size grows.},

   Abstract = {The paper examines the possible relationship of anomalous variations of different atmospheric and ionospheric parameters observed around the time of a strong earthquake (Mw 7.8) which occurred in Mexico (state of Colima) on 21 January 2003. These variations are interpreted within the framework of the developed model of the Lithosphere-Atmosphere-Ionosphere coupling. The main attention is focused on the processes in the near ground layer of the atmosphere involving the ionization of air by radon, the water molecules’ attachment to the formed ions, and the corresponding changes in the latent heat. Model considerations are supported by experimental measurements showing the local diminution of air humidity one week prior to the earthquake, accompanied by the anomalous thermal infrared (TIR) signals and surface latent heat flux (SLHF) and anomalous variations of the total electron content (TEC) registered over the epicenter of the impending earthquake three days prior to the main earthquake event. Statistical processing of the data of the GPS receivers network, together with various other atmospheric parameters demonstrate the possibility of an early warning of an impending strong earthquake.},

   Abstract = {The dominant source of error in most long-term integrations of the solar system is roundoff, which leads to a fractional energy error of order $n\epsilon$ where $n$ is the number of steps and $\epsilon$ is the precision of the floating-point arithmetic.  The most accurate computers are those with optimal floating-point arithmetic, that is, arithmetic in which the result of evaluating an arithmetic expression is the representable number closest to the true value of that expression.  We argue that when floating-point arithemtic is optimal, most of the roundoff error arises from two sources: the approximate representation of the numerical coefficients used in multistep integration formulas, and the additions required to evaluate these formulas.  We present an algorithm that removes these two sources of error in computers with optimal arithmetic, and appears to reduce the fractional energy error to of order $n^{0.5}\epsilon$ (at least for $n\lta \times 10^7$), at the cost of less than a factor of 2 in computing time.},

First, the computation of a refined orbit is much more expensive than the computation of the original noisy orbit, and therefore it is not practical to use shadowing to provide direct accuracy estimates for all numerical solutions of the GNP, especially not for problems with a large number of particles moving simultaneously.  The best that can be done is to estimate the errors in a few representative systems.  Second, there is no guarantee that the shadow orbits are ``typical'' (\ie that their statistical properties are the same as those of true orbits chosen at random), although there is no reason to suppose otherwise.  In spite of these limitations, the existence of shadow orbits shows that numerical integrations of $N$-body systems can yield orbits that closely resemble true orbits, and, we believe, puts the validity of these integrations on a sounder footing.},

   Abstract = {Strong, rapidly rotating, persistent bars readily form in numerical simulations of initially axisymmetric disk galaxies.  The global dynamical instability reponsible for this behviour is a great embarrassment to the subject of galactic dynamics, as most galaxies in the sky do not possess a strong bar;  the suggestion that the dark matter content of galaxies might resolve this discreapancy is unattractive.  Here we present the results of three-dimensional simulations which show that the bar is dynamically unstable to buckling out of the galactic plane (the majority of previous disk galaxy simulations have been strictly two-dimensional).  Stars acquire large motions normal to the plane, giving the bar a peanut shape through a mechanism that we suggest to be the fire-hose instability.  Bars may be weakened or even destroyed by this instability;  thus the fraction of disk galaxies containing strong bars today could be lower than the fraction in which they have formed in the past.  The instability may also account for the peanut morphology of many galaxies, and because it leads to a less flattened stellar system with increased central density, it may play a part in the formation of galactic bulges.},

   Abstract = {The evolutionary interaction between influenza A virus and the human immune system, manifest as 'antigenic drift' of the viral haemagglutinin, is one of the best described patterns in molecular evolution. However, little is known about the genome- scale evolutionary dynamics of this pathogen. Similarly, how genomic processes relate to global influenza epidemiology, in which the A/ H3N2 and A/ H1N1 subtypes co- circulate, is poorly understood. Here through an analysis of 1,302 complete viral genomes sampled from temperate populations in both hemispheres, we show that the genomic evolution of influenza A virus is characterized by a complex interplay between frequent reassortment and periodic selective sweeps. The A/ H3N2 and A/ H1N1 subtypes exhibit different evolutionary dynamics, with diverse lineages circulating in A/ H1N1, indicative of weaker antigenic drift. These results suggest a sink - source model of viral ecology in which new lineages are seeded from a persistent influenza reservoir, which we hypothesize to be located in the tropics, to sink populations in temperate regions.},

   Abstract = {We propose a new method for estimating parameters in models that are defined by a system of non-linear differential equations. Such equations represent changes in system outputs by linking the behaviour of derivatives of a process to the behaviour of the process itself. Current methods for estimating parameters in differential equations from noisy data are computationally intensive and often poorly suited to the realization of statistical objectives such as inference and interval estimation. The paper describes a new method that uses noisy measurements on a subset of variables to estimate the parameters defining a system of non-linear differential equations. The approach is based on a modification of data smoothing methods along with a generalization of profiled estimation. We derive estimates and confidence intervals, and show that these have low bias and good coverage properties respectively for data that are simulated from models in chemical engineering and neurobiology. The performance of the method is demonstrated by using real world data from chemistry and from the progress of the autoimmune disease lupus.},

   Abstract = {Animals that forage socially(1) often stand to gain from coordination of their behaviour(2-5). Yet it is not known how group members reach a consensus on the timing of foraging bouts. Here we demonstrate a simple process by which this may occur. We develop a state-dependent, dynamic game model(6) of foraging by a pair of animals, in which each individual chooses between resting or foraging during a series of consecutive periods, so as to maximize its own individual chances of survival(6,7). We find that, if there is an advantage to foraging together(1,2,8), the equilibrium behaviour of both individuals becomes highly synchronized. As a result of this synchronization, differences in the energetic reserves of the two players spontaneously develop, leading them to adopt different behavioural roles. The individual with lower reserves emerges as the 'pace-maker' who determines when the pair should forage, providing a straightforward resolution to the problem of group coordination. Moreover, the strategy that gives rise to this behaviour can be implemented by a simple 'rule of thumb'(9) that requires no detailed knowledge of the state of other individuals.},

   Abstract = {Background. Many soldiers in Napoleon's Grand Army died of infectious diseases during its retreat from Russia. Because soldiers were commonly infested with body lice, it has been speculated that louse-borne infectious diseases, such as epidemic typhus (caused by Rickettsia prowazekii), were common. Methods. We investigated this possibility during recent excavations of a mass grave of Napoleon's soldiers in Vilnius, Lithuania. Segments of 5 body lice, identified morphologically and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing, were found in earth from the grave that also contained fragments of soldiers' uniforms. Results. DNA of Bartonella quintana (the agent of trench fever) was identified by PCR and sequencing in 3 of the lice. Similarly, PCR and sequencing of dental pulp from the remains of 35 soldiers revealed DNA of B. quintana in 7 soldiers and DNA of R. prowazekii in 3 other soldiers. Conclusions. Our results show that louse-borne infectious diseases affected nearly one-third of Napoleon's soldiers buried in Vilnius and indicate that these diseases might have been a major factor in the French retreat from Russia.},

   Pages = {322-335},
   Abstract = {Selective activation of T helper (Th) cell subsets plays an impor tant role in immune response to pathogens as well as in the 
pathogenesis of human allergy and inflammator y diseases. Th1 cells along with the recently discovered Th17 cells play a 
role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Th2 cytokines lead to series of inflammator y processes characteristic for 
asthma and other atopic diseases. To understand the pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases it is crucial to dissect 
pathways and regulatory networks leading to the development of distinct Th subsets. Such knowledge may lead to better 
strategies for developing diagnostics and therapies for these diseases. The differentiation of Th1, Th2, and Th17 effector 
cells is driven by signals originating from T cell and costimulator y receptors as well as cytokines in the surroundings of 
activated naive T helper cells. There are several proteins involved in the regulation of this differentiation process. Most of 
the data on T helper cell differentiation have been acquired using mouse. In this review, we have summarized what is known 
about human T helper differentiation. In addition, selected differences between human and mouse will be discussed.

   Abstract = {Background: Social status is an important predictor of poor health. Most studies of this issue have focused on the lower echelons of society.
Objective: To determine whether the increase in status from winning an academy award is associated with long-term mortality among actors and actresses.
Design: Retrospective cohort analysis.
Setting: Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
Participants: All actors and actresses ever nominated for an academy award in a leading or a supporting role were identified (n = 762). For each, another cast member of the same sex who was in the same film and was born in the same era was identified (n =887).
Measurements: Life expectancy and all-cause mortality rates. Results: All 1649 performers were analyzed; the median duration
of follow-up time from birth was 66 years, and 772 deaths occurred (primarily from ischemic heart disease and malignant disease). Life expectancy was 3.9 years longer for Academy Award winners than for other, less recognized performers (79.7 vs. 75.8 years; P = 0.003). This difference was equal to a 28\% relative reduction in death rates (95\% CI, 10\% to 42\%). Adjustment for birth year, sex, and ethnicity yielded similar results, as did adjustments for birth country, possible name change, age at release of first film, and total films in career. Additional wins were associated with a 22\% relative reduction in death rates (CI, 5\% to 35\%), whereas additional films and additional nominations were not associated with a significant reduction in death rates.
Conclusion: The association of high status with increased longevity that prevails in the public also extends to celebrities, contributes to a large survival advantage, and is partially explained by factors related to success.},

   Journal = {BMC Infectious Diseases},
   Volume = {10},
   Number = {5},
   Abstract = {Background: A pandemic novel H1N1 swine-origin influenza virus has emerged. Most recently the World Health Organization has announced that in a country-dependent fashion, up to 15\% of cases may require hospitalization, often including respiratory support. It is now clear that healthy children and young adults are disproportionately affected, most unusually among those with severe respiratory disease without underlying conditions. One possible explanation for this case age distribution is the doctrine of Original Antigenic Sin, i.e., novel H1N1 may be antigenically similar to H1N1 viruses that circulated at an earlier time. Persons whose first exposure to influenza viruses was to such similar viruses would be relatively immune. However, this principle is not sufficient to explain the graded susceptibility between ages 20 and 60, the reduced susceptibility in children below age 10, and the unusual toxicity observed.
Methods: We collected case data from 11 countries, about 60\% of all cases reported through mid-July 2009. We compared sequence data for the hemagglutinin of novel H1N1 with sequences of H1N1 viruses from 1918 to the present. We searched for sequence differences that imply loss of antigenicity either directly through amino acid substitution or by the appearance of sites for potential glycosylation proximal to sites known to be antigenic in humans. We also considered T-cell epitopes.
Results: In our composite, over 75\% of confirmed cases of novel H1N1 occurred in persons <= 30 years old, with peak incidence in the age range 10-19 years. Less than 3\% of cases occurred in persons over 65, with a gradation in incidence between ages 20 and 60 years. The sequence data indicates that novel H1N1 is most similar to H1N1 viruses that circulated before 1943. Novel H1N1 lacks glycosylation sites on the globular head of hemagglutinin (HA1) near antigenic regions, a pattern shared with the 1918 pandemic strain and H1N1 viruses that circulated until the early 1940s. Later H1N1 viruses progressively added new glycosylation sites likely to shield antigenic epitopes, while T-cell epitopes were relatively unchanged.
Conclusions: In this evolutionary context, Original Antigenic Sin exposure should produce an immune response increasingly mismatched to novel H1N1 in progressively younger persons. We suggest that it is this mismatch that produces both the gradation in susceptibility and the unusual toxicity. Several murine studies suggest specific cell types as a likely basis of the unusual toxicity. These studies also point to widely available pharmaceutical agents as plausible candidates for mitigating the toxic effects. The principle of Original Antigenic Sin modified by glycosylation appears to explain both the case age distribution and the unusual toxicity pattern of the novel H1N1 pandemic. In addition, it suggests pharmaceutical agents for immediate investigation for mitigation potential, and provides strategic guidance for the distribution of pandemic mitigation resources of all types.},

We propose a simple mathematical model to investigate the dynamics of a novel pathogenic strain that emerges in a population where a previous strain is maintained at low endemic level by a vaccine. We compare three methods to assess the ability of the novel strain to invade and persist: algebraic rate of invasion; deterministic dynamics; and stochastic dynamics. These three techniques provide complementary predictions on the fate of the system. In particular, we emphasize the importance of stochastic simulations, which account for the possibility of extinctions of either strain. More specifically, our model suggests that the probability of persistence of an invasive strain (i) can be minimized for intermediate levels of vaccine cross-protection (i.e. immune protection against the novel strain) and (ii) is lower if cross-immunity acts through a reduced infectious period rather than through reduced susceptibility.},

   Abstract = {T cells develop in the thymus and then are exported to the periphery. As one ages, the lymphoid mass of the thymus decreases, and a concomitant decrease in the ability to produce new T cells results. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects CD4(+) T cells and, hence, can also affect thymic function. Here we discuss experimental techniques and mathematical models that aim to quantify the rate of thymic export. We focus on a recent technique involving the quantification of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs). We discuss how proper interpretation of TREC data necessitates the critical development of appropriate mathematical models. We review the theory for interpretation of TREC data during aging, HIV infection, and anti-retroviral treatment.

Here, we analyse historical vital statistics and quantify the age-speciﬁc mortality patterns associated with the 1918–1920 inﬂuenza pandemic in Japan, USA, and UK. All three countries showed highly elevated mortality risk in young adults relative to surrounding non-pandemic years. By contrast, the risk of death was low in the very young and very old. In Japan, the overall mortality impact was not limited to winter 1918–1919, and continued during winter 1919–1920. Mortality impact varied as much as threefold across the 47 Japanese prefectures, and diﬀerences in baseline mortality, population demographics, and density explained a small fraction of these variations. Our study highlights important geographical variations in timing and mortality impact of historical pandemics, in particular between the Eastern and Western hemispheres. In a future pandemic, vaccination in one region could save lives even months after the emergence of a pandemic virus in another region.},

   Abstract = {We present an analysis of the first 10 weeks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong. The epidemic to date has been characterized by two large clusters, initiated by two separate "super-spread" events (SSEs), and ongoing community transmission. By fitting a stochastic model to data on 1512 cases, including these clusters, we show that the etiological agent of SARS is moderately transmissible. Excluding SSEs, we estimate 2.7 secondary infections were generated per case on average at the start of the epidemic, with a substantial contribution from hospital transmission. Transmission rates fell during the epidemic, primarily due to reductions in population contact rates and improved hospital infection control, but also as a result of more rapid hospital attendance by symptomatic individuals. As a result, the epidemic is now in decline, though continued vigilance is necessary for this to be maintained. Restrictions on longer-range population movement are shown to be a potentially useful additional control measure in some contexts. We estimate that most currently infected persons are now hospitalized, emphasizing the importance of control of nosocomial transmission.},

We used an individual-based spatial model of smallpox transmission in Great Britain and census-derived journey-to-work data to accurately describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of an outbreak of smallpox in the community. A Markov chain Monte-Carlo algorithm was developed to generate sociospatial contact networks that were consistent with demographic and commuting data. We tested the sensitivity of model predictions to key epidemiological parameters before choosing three representative scenarios from within the range explored. We examined the spatiotemporal dynamics for these illustrative scenarios and assessed the efficacy of symptomatic case isolation, contact tracing with vaccination, and reactive regional mass vaccination as policy options for control. We conclude that case isolation and contact tracing with vaccination would be sufficient to halt ongoing transmission rapidly, unless policy effectiveness was compromised by resource or other constraints. A slight reduction in the expected size and duration of an outbreak could be achieved with regional mass vaccination, but these benefits are small and do not justify the high numbers of vaccine doses required and their associated negative side effects.},

   Abstract = {A long-standing problem in biological and social sciences is to understand the conditions required for the emergence and maintenance of cooperation in evolving populations. For many situations, kin selection(1) is an adequate explanation, although kin-recognition may still be a problem. Explanations of cooperation between non-kin include continuing interactions that provide a shadow of the future (that is, the expectation of an ongoing relationship) that can sustain reciprocity(2-4), possibly supported by mechanisms to bias interactions such as embedding the agents in a two-dimensional space(4-6) or other context-preserving networks(7). Another explanation, indirect reciprocity(8), applies when benevolence to one agent increases the chance of receiving help from others. Here we use computer simulations to show that cooperation can arise when agents donate to others who are sufficiently similar to themselves in some arbitrary characteristic. Such a characteristic, or 'tag', can be a marking, display, or other observable trait. Tag-based donation can lead to the emergence of cooperation among agents who have only rudimentary ability to detect environmental signals and, unlike models of direct(3,4) or indirect reciprocity(9,10), no memory of past encounters is required.},

   Abstract = {The 1918–1919 inﬂuenza pandemic was composed of multiple waves within a period of nine months in several regions of the world. Increasing our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for this multi-wave proﬁle has important public health implications. We model the transmission dynamics of two strains of inﬂuenza interacting via cross-immunity to simulate two temporal waves of inﬂuenza and explore the impact of the basic reproduction number, as a measure of transmissibility associated to each inﬂuenza strain, cross-immunity and the timing of the onset of the second inﬂuenza epidemic on the pandemic proﬁle. We use time series of case notiﬁcations during the 1918 inﬂuenza pandemic in Geneva, Switzerland, for illustration. We calibrate our mathematical model to the initial wave of infection to estimate the basic reproduction number of the ﬁrst wave and the corresponding timing of onset of the second inﬂuenza variant. We use this information to explore the impact of cross-immunity levels on the dynamics of the second wave of inﬂuenza. Our results for the 1918 pandemic in Geneva, 
Switzerland, indicate that a second wave can occur whenever R0 1 o1:5 or when cross-immunity levels are less than 0.58 for our estimated R0 2 of 2.4. We also explore qualitatively proﬁles of two-wave pandemics and compare them with real temporal proﬁles of the 1918 inﬂuenza pandemic in other regions of the world including several Scandinavian cities, New York City, England and Wales, and Sydney, Australia. Pandemic proﬁles are classiﬁed into three broad categories namely ‘‘right-handed’’, 
‘‘left-handed’’, and ‘‘M-shape’’. Our results indicate that avoiding a second inﬂuenza epidemic is plausible given sufﬁcient levels of cross-protection are attained via natural infection during an early (herald) wave of infection or vaccination campaigns prior to a second wave. Furthermore, interventions aimed at mitigating the ﬁrst pandemic wave may be counterproductive by increasing the chances of a second wave of infection that could potentially be more virulent than the ﬁrst.},

The model is then modified to reflect a variety of control strategies based oil social distancing measures, targeted antiviral treatment and antiviral prophylaxis and home quarantine, and the effectiveness of the strategies is compared. The results suggest that the only single strategy that would be successful in preventing an epidemic (with R-0=2.0) is targeted antiviral treatment and prophylaxis, and that closing schools combined with either closing work places or home quarantine would only prevent such an epidemic if these strategies were combined with a modest level of antiviral coverage.},

We employ a renewal process which accounts for imported cases, illustrate some technical pitfalls, and propose a novel estimation method to address these pitfalls. Explicitly accounting for the infection-age distribution of imported cases and for the delay in transmission dynamics due to international travel, R was estimated to be 1: 25 (95\% confidence interval: 1: 07,1: 47). Hence we show that a previous study, which did not account for these factors, overestimated R. Our approach also permitted us to examine the infection-age at which secondary transmission occurs as a function of calendar time, demonstrating the downward bias during the beginning of the epidemic. These technical issues may compromise the usefulness of a well-known estimator of R - the inverse of the moment-generating function of the generation time given the intrinsic growth rate. Explicit modelling of the infection-age distribution among imported cases and the examination of the time dependency of the generation time play key roles in avoiding a biased estimate of R, especially when one only has data covering a short time interval during the early growth phase of the epidemic.},

Furthermore, the signaling and nonsignaling equilibria are linked by a continuum of equilibria where chicks above a certain condition do not signal and we show that, contrary to intuition, fitness increases monotonically as the proportion of young that signal decreases. This result forces us to reconsider much of the current literature on signaling of need and highlights the need to investigate the evolutionary stability of signaling equilibria based on the handicap principle.},

   Abstract = {Most models of dynamics of infectious diseases have assumed homogeneous mixing in the host population. However, it is increasingly recognized that heterogeneity can arise through many processes. It is then important to consider the existence of subpopulations of hosts, and that the contact rate within subpopulations is different than that between subpopulations. We study models with hosts distributed in subpopulations as a consequence of spatial partitioning. Two types of models are considered. In the first one there is direct transmission. The second one is a model of dynamics of a mosquito-borne disease, with indirect transmission, and applicable to malaria. The contact between subpopulations is achieved through the visits of hosts. Two types of visit are considered: a first one in which the visit time is independent of the distance travelled, and a second one in which visit time decreases with distance. There are two types of spatial arrangement: one dimensional, and two dimensional. Conditions fur the establishment of the disease are obtained. Results indicate that the disease becomes established with greater difficulty when the degree of spatial partition increases, and when visit time decreases. In addition, when visit time decreases with distance, the establishment of the disease is more difficult when the spatial arrangement is one dimensional than when it is two dimensional. The results indicate the importance of knowing the spatial distribution and mobility patterns to understand the, dynamics of infectious diseases. The consequences of these results fur the design of public health policies are discussed. (C) 2001 Society for Mathematical Biology.},

   Abstract = {An important issue in the history of ecology has been the study of the relative importance of deterministic forces and processes noise in shaping the dynamics of ecological populations. We address this question by exploring the temporal dynamics of two childhood infections, measles and whooping cough, in England and Wales. We demonstrate that epidemics of whooping cough are strongly influenced by stochasticity; fully deterministic approaches cannot achieve even a qualitative fit to the observed data. In contrast, measles dynamics are extremely well explained by a deterministic model. These differences are shown to be caused by their contrasting responses to dynamical noise due to different infectious periods.},

   Abstract = {An important issue in population biology is the dynamic interaction between pathogens. Interest has focused mainly on the indirect interaction of pathogen strains, mediated by cross immunity(1-4). However, a mechanism has recently been proposed for 'ecological interference' between pathogens through the removal of individuals from the susceptible pool after an acute infection. To explore this possibility, we have analysed and modelled historical measles and whooping cough records. Here we show that ecological interference is particularly strong when fatal infections permanently remove susceptibles. Disease interference has substantial dynamical consequences, making multi-annual outbreaks of different infections characteristically out of phase. So, when disease prevalence is high and is associated with significant mortality, it might be impossible to understand epidemic patterns by studying pathogens in isolation. This new ecological null model has important consequences for understanding the multi-strain dynamics of pathogens such as dengue and echoviruses.},

We conclude that capsaicin-sensitive fibers traveling within the hepatic vagal branch constitute a necessary component of the afferent mechanism of the febrile response to low, but not high, doses of circulating pyrogens, We speculate that this mechanism is triggered by blood-borne prostaglandins of the E series.},

   Pages = {2009-2016},
   Abstract = {The result of population crosses on traits such as mating rate, oviposition rate and survivorship are increasingly used to distinguish between modes of coevolution between the sexes. Two key hypotheses, erected from a verbal theory of sexually antagonistic coevolution, have been the subject of several recent tests. First, statistical interactions arising in population crosses are suggested to be indicative of a complex signal/receiver system. In the case of oviposition rates, an interaction between populations (x, y and z) would be indicated by the rank order of female oviposition rates achieved by x, y and z males changing depending upon the female (x, y or z) with which they mated. Second, under sexually antagonistic coevolution females will do 'best' when mated with their own males, where best is defined by the weakest response to the signal and the highest fitness. We test these hypotheses by crossing strains generated from a formal model of sexually antagonistic coev!  olution. Strains differ in the strength of natural selection acting on male and female traits. In our model, we assume sexually antagonistic coevolution of a single male signal and female receptor. The female receptor is treated as a preference function where both the slope and intercept of the function can evolve. Our results suggest that neither prediction is consistently supported. Interactions are not diagnostic of complex signal-receiver systems, and even under sexually antagonistic coevolution, females may do better mating with males of strains other than their own. These results suggest a reinterpretation of several recent experiments and have important implications for developing theories of speciation when sexually antagonistic coevolution is involved.},

   Journal = {PLoS One},
   Volume = {4},

   Pages = {e7359},
   Abstract = {Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are recently identified lentiviruses that cause progressive immune decline and ultimately death in infected cats and humans. It is of great interest to understand how to prevent immune system collapse caused by these lentiviruses. We recently described that disease caused by a virulent FIV strain in cats can be attenuated if animals are first infected with a feline immunodeficiency virus derived from a wild cougar. The detailed temporal tracking of cat immunological parameters in response to two viral infections resulted in high-dimensional datasets containing variables that exhibit strong co-variation. Initial analyses of these complex data using univariate statistical techniques did not account for interactions among immunological response variables and therefore potentially obscured significant effects between infection state and immunological parameters.
Methodology and Principal Findings
Here, we apply a suite of multivariate statistical tools, including Principal Component Analysis, MANOVA and Linear Discriminant Analysis, to temporal immunological data resulting from FIV superinfection in domestic cats. We investigated the co-variation among immunological responses, the differences in immune parameters among four groups of five cats each (uninfected, single and dual infected animals), and the “immune profiles” that discriminate among them over the first four weeks following superinfection. Dual infected cats mount an immune response by 24 days post superinfection that is characterized by elevated levels of CD8 and CD25 cells and increased expression of IL4 and IFNγ, and FAS. This profile discriminates dual infected cats from cats infected with FIV alone, which show high IL-10 and lower numbers of CD8 and CD25 cells.
Conclusions
Multivariate statistical analyses demonstrate both the dynamic nature of the immune response to FIV single and dual infection and the development of a unique immunological profile in dual infected cats, which are protected from immune decline.},

   Abstract = {Background The cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been identified as a new coronavirus. Whole genome sequence analysis of various isolates might provide an indication of potential strain differences of this new virus. Moreover, mutation analysis will help to develop effective vaccines. Methods We sequenced the entire SARS viral genome of cultured isolates from the index case (SIN2500) presenting in Singapore, from three primary contacts (SIN2774, SIN2748, and SIN2677), and one secondary contact (SIN2679). These sequences were compared with the isolates from Canada (TOR2), Hong Kong (CUHK-W1 and HKU39849), Hanoi (URBANI), Guangzhou (GZ01), and Beijing (BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04). Findings We identified 129 sequence variations among the 14 isolates, with 16 recurrent variant sequences. Common variant sequences at four loci define two distinct genotypes of the SARS virus. One genotype was linked with infections originating in Hotel M in Hong Kong, the second contained isolates from Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Beijing with no association with Hotel M (p<0.0001). Moreover, other common sequence variants further distinguished the geographical origins of the isolates, especially between Singapore and Beijing. Interpretation Despite the recent onset of the SARS epidemic, genetic signatures are emerging that partition the worldwide SARS viral isolates into groups on the basis of contact source history and geography. These signatures can be used to trace sources of infection. In addition, a common variant associated with a non-conservative aminoacid change in the S1 region of the spike protein, suggests that immunological pressures might be starting to influence the evolution of the SARS virus in human populations.},

   Abstract = {Levins's fitness set approach has shaped the intuition of many evolutionary ecologists about resource specialization: if the set of possible phenotypes is convex, a generalist is favored, while either of the two specialists is predicted for concave phenotype sets. An important aspect of Levins's approach is that it explicitly excludes frequency-dependent selection. Frequency dependence emerged in a series of models that studied the degree of character displacement of two consumers coexisting on two resources. Surprisingly, the evolutionary dynamics of a single consumer type under frequency dependence has not been studied in detail. We analyze a model of one evolving consumer feeding on two resources and show that, depending on the trait considered to be subject to evolutionary change, selection is either frequency independent or frequency dependent. This difference is explained by the effects different foraging traits have on the consumer-resource interactions. If selection is frequency dependent, then the population can become dimorphic through evolutionary branching at the trait value of the generalist. Those traits with frequency-independent selection, however, do indeed follow the predictions based on Levins's fitness set approach. This dichotomy in the evolutionary dynamics of traits involved in the same foraging process was not previously recognized.},

   Abstract = {In 1991 the Edmonton Board of Health (EBH) entered into a partnership with seven senior citizen recreation centres to improve the efficiency of influenza immunization delivery by public health nurses in Edmonton. This initiative was driven by an annual increase in demand for flu vaccine coupled with diminishing health unit resources and a desire to collaborate with key community groups. A pilot project established that a cooperative approach could be more efficient than the previous health centre appointment model. In October 1991, 13,633 individuals were immunized with the assistance of 202 volunteer seniors who contributed 1,700 hours of their time. Unit labour costs incurred by the EBH were reduced by 40%. This model of delivery resulted in earlier completion of the flu immunization program and forged strong community alliances between the Edmonton Board of Health and the staff and volunteers of the seniors' recreational centres.},

   Abstract = {This work studies the radial orbit instability for a family of anisotropic isochrone spheres by a numerical linear stability analysis, and then compares the results with $N$-body simulations.  A new way of choosing basis functions for the modes is introduced that allows spatially infinite systems to be handled without truncation.  Previous studies of the same models, by adiabatic deformation and by $N$-body integrations, found instability for $\avg{v_r^2}/\avg{v_\theta^2}\gta2$; the present computations indicate that very slowly growing modes persist for anisotropies as small as $\avg{v_r^2}/\avg{v_\theta^2}\simeq 1.4$.  For the more unstable models, the shapes and growth rates of the modes are fairly well reproduced in $N$-body simulations.  These results suggest that spherical models are unstable over a wider range of anisotropies than previously supposed.},

For any $g(E,L)$ there is a unique $f$, though positivity is not guaranteed.  The paper then picks a two-parameter family of models and studies the radial orbit instability by linear theory.  The results indicate that the anisotropy of the core is important for the instability, but not independently of other features (such as the asymptotic small-$E$ behaviour of $f$) and it appears that there is no simple general criterion for predicting instability.},

   Journal = {Behaviour},
   Volume = {136},
   Pages = {1335-1346},
   Abstract = {Female sagebrush crickets (Cyphoderris strepitans) feed on males' fleshy hind wings during copulation and ingest haemolymph oozing from the wounds they inflict. The wounds are not fatal and usually only a portion of the hind wings are eaten at any one mating, so that mated males are not precluded from mating again. However, based on their relative abundance in the population, virgin males have a higher mating success than non-virgin males. One explanation for this virgin-male mating advantage is that non-virgin males, having been depleted of their energy reserves through the wing-feeding behaviour of their mates, are unable to sustain the same level of acoustic signalling they produce prior to copulation. Previous assays of male signalling behaviour have provided some support to this hypothesis. However, an alternative explanation is that females actively seek out virgin males as mates because of the greater material resources they offer. If the acoustic structure of males signals were systematically altered by the loss of hind- wing material underlying the sound-producing tegmina, females could potentially discriminate against mated males through reduced phonotaxis to their calls. We tested this hypothesis by experimentally removing one hind wing from virgin males, thereby simulating the non-virgin condition without the attendant costs of copulation. We compared the mating success of these 'asymmetrical' males with that of sham-operated virgin males when competing under natural conditions. In a companion laboratory study, we used time-lapse video recording to examine the possibility that female preferences are exerted only after pair formation has occurred. There was no significant difference in male mating success across treatments in either study. We conclude, therefore, that the virgin-male mating advantage does not stem from an acoustically mediated, non- independent female mating preference, but rather, from the differential competitiveness of males.},

Sensitivity analysis is used to ascertain how a given model output depends upon the input parameters. This is an important method for checking the quality of a given model, as well as a powerful tool for checking the robustness and reliability of its analysis. The topic is acknowledged as essential for good modelling practice, and is an implicit part of any modelling field. 
*	Offers an accessible introduction to sensitivity 
*	Covers all the latest research 
*	Illustrates concepts with numerous examples, applications and case studies 
*	Includes contributions from the leading researchers active in developing strategies for sensitivity analysis 
The principles of sensitivity analysis are carefully described, and suitable methods for approaching many types of problems are given. The book introduces the modeller to the entire casual assessment chain, from data to predictions, whilst explaining the impact of source uncertainties and framing assumptions. A 'hitch-hiker's guide' is included to allow the more experienced reader to readily access specific applications. 
Modellers from a wide range of disciplines, including biostatistics, economics, environmental impact assessment, chemistry and engineering will benefit greatly from the numerous examples and applications.},

A serial cross-sectional study of nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage in healthy, home-living children <= 6 years of age was conducted in four rural communities-two in Utah (1998-2003) and two in Idaho (2002-2003). Prevalence odds ratios for carriage of resistant pneumococci (ORres) and of susceptible pneumococci (ORsus) were estimated. Dynamic transmission models were developed to facilitate a mechanistic interpretation of ORres and ORsus and to compare the population impact of distinct antimicrobial classes. A total of 5,667 cultures were obtained; 25% of the cultures were positive, and 29% of isolates exhibited reduced susceptibility to penicillin. The adjusted ORres for recent individual and sibling cephalosporin use was 2.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.4, 3.4) and 1.8 (95% confidence interval: 1.0, 3.3), respectively. Neither individual nor sibling penicillin use was associated with increased ORres. Rather, recent use of penicillins was associated with decreased carriage of susceptible pneumococci (ORsus = 0.2, 95% confidence interval: 0.1, 0.3). In simulations, both types of effects promoted dissemination of resistant pneumococci at the population level. Findings show that oral cephalosporins enhance the risk of acquiring resistant pneumococci. Penicillins accelerate clearance of susceptible strains. The effect of penicillins in increasing resistance is shared equally by treated and untreated members of the population.},

   Pages = {778-809},
   Abstract = {Tremendous progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis of the antiviral actions of interferons (IFNs), as well as strategies evolved by viruses to antagonize the actions of IFNs. Furthermore, advances made while elucidating the IFN system have contributed significantly to our understanding in multiple areas of virology and molecular cell biology, ranging from pathways of signal transduction to the biochemical mechanisms of transcriptional and translational control to the molecular basis of viral pathogenesis. IFNs are approved therapeutics and have moved from the basic research laboratory to the clinic. Among the IFN-induced proteins important in the antiviral actions of IFNs are the RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), the 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and RNase L, and the Mx protein GTPases. Double-stranded RNA plays a central role in modulating protein phosphorylation and RNA degradation catalyzed by the IFN-inducible PKR kinase and the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate-dependent RNase L, respectively, and also in RNA editing by the IFN-inducible RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR1). IFN also induces a form of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS2) and the major histocompatibility complex class I and II proteins, all of which play important roles in immune response to infections. Several additional genes whose expression profiles are altered in response to IFN treatment and virus infection have been identified by microarray analyses. The availability of cDNA and genomic clones for many of the components of the IFN system, including IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and IFN-gamma, their receptors, Jak and Stat and IRF signal transduction components, and proteins such as PKR, 2',5'-OAS, Mx, and ADAR, whose expression is regulated by IFNs, has permitted the generation of mutant proteins, cells that overexpress different forms of the proteins, and animals in which their expression has been disrupted by targeted gene disruption. The use of these IFN system reagents, both in cell culture and in whole animals, continues to provide important contributions to our understanding of the virus-host interaction and cellular antiviral response.},

   Abstract = {The basic reproductive rate (R-0) is a measure of the severity of an epidemic. On the basis of replicated Latin hypercube sampling, the authors performed an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive rate of tuberculosis (TB). The uncertainty analysis allowed for the derivation of a frequency distribution for R-0 and the assessment of the relative contribution each of the three components of R-0 made when TB epidemics first arose centuries ago. (The three components of R-0 are associated with fast, slow, and relapse TB.) R-0 estimates indicated the existence of fairly severe epidemics when TB epidemics first arose. The R-0 for the susceptible persons who developed TB slowly (R-0(Slow)) contributed the most to the R-0 estimates; however, the relative R-0(Slow) contribution decreased as the severity of TB epidemics increased. The sensitivity of the magnitude of R-0 to the uncertainty in estimating values of each of the input parameters was assessed. These results indicated that five of the nine input parameters, because of their estimation uncertainty, were influential in determining the magnitude of R-0. This uncertainty and sensitivity methodology provides results that can aid investigators in understanding the historical epidemiology of TB by quantifying the effect of the transmission processes involved. Additionally, this method can be applied to the R-0 of any other infectious disease to estimate the probability of an epidemic outbreak.},

   Journal = {Virology},

   Number = {1},
   Pages = {163-173},
   Abstract = {The M2 protein of influenza virus forms ion channels activated by low pH which are proton permeable and play a key role in the life cycle of the virus. M2 is a 97-residue integral membrane protein containing a single transmembrane (TM) helix. M2 is present as disulfide-linked homotetramers. The TM domain of M2 has been modeled as a bundle of four parallel M2 helices. The helix bundle forms a left-handed supercoil surrounding a central pore. Residue H37 has been implicated in the mechanism of low-pH activation of the channel. Models generated with H37 in a fully deprotonated state exhibit a pore occluded by a ring or H37 side chains oriented toward the lumen of the pore. Models with H37 in a fully protonated state no longer exhibit such occlusion of the pore, as the H37 side chains adopt a more interracial location. Extended molecular dynamics simulations with water molecules within and at the mouths of the pores support this distinction between the H37-deprotonated and H37- protonated models. These simulations suggest that only in the H37-protonated model is there a continuous column of water extending the entire length of the central pore. A mechanism for activation of M2 by low pH is presented in which the H37- deprotonated model corresponds to the ''closed'' form of the channel, while the H37-protonated model corresponds to the ''open'' form. A switch from the closed to the open form of the channel occurs if H37 is protonated midway through a simulation. The open channel is suggested to contain a wire of H-bonded water molecules which enables proton permeability. (C) 1997 Academic Press.},

   Volume = {12},
   Number = {6},
   Pages = {736-748},
   Abstract = {Several factors play critical roles in the geographic spread of infectious diseases, including the movement of people between communities and the social and economic structure of groups of communities. A mathematical model has been developed to examine the individual and shared impact of these factors. This model was applied to the spread of the 1918-1919 influenza epidemic in three Aboriginal communities in central Canada. Previously published results from simulations of the model used parameter estimates for mobility patterns that were derived from historical documents from the study communities, especially Hudson's Bay Company post journals. We have termed this model the Frontier pattern. In this paper we extend that work to consider the consequences of three additional travel scenarios, which represent idealized trade and travel relationships between different communities. The three patterns include (a) the Central Marketplace scenario, an idealization of relations between a central community and its satellites in which a single central community satisfies all needs of the satellite communities; (b) the Sister Towns scenario, which allows travel among all communities and overemphasizes communication between satellites so that the ramifications of small town interactions are easier to observe; and (c) the Circuit scenario, which represents a hypothetical trade network that is a series of unidirectional dyad relationships linking all communities within a region. Results from simulations of the four mobility patterns are compared to assess the potential impact different social and economic relationships among communities may have had on the geographic spread of the 1918 influenza epidemic in central Canada and in other regions. These results reinforce conclusions that show that variation in patterns of mobility significantly influences the timing of epidemic peaks but only minimally alters the number of cases within a community. In addition, comparisons of the different models indicate that a central location in the social and political hierarchy of a region may be more important in influencing patterns of epidemic spread than just a central location with regard to travel patterns. Furthermore, who was actually travelling and where they were travelling had important consequences for epidemic spread. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   Volume = {65},
   Number = {1},
   Pages = {1-26},
   Abstract = {Quarantine is often proposed and sometimes used to control the spread of infectious diseases through a human population. Yet there is usually little or no information on the effectiveness of attempting to quarantine humans that is not of an anecdotal or conjectural nature. This paper describes how a compartmental model for the geographic spread of infectious diseases can be used to address the potential effectiveness of human quarantine. The model is applied to data from the historical record in central Canada around the time of the 1918-19 influenza epidemic. Information on the daily mobility patterns of individuals engaged in the fur trade throughout the region prior to, during, and immediately after the epidemic are used to determine whether rates of travel were affected by informal quarantine policies imposed by community leaders. The model is then used to assess the impact of observed differences in travel on the spread of the epidemic. Results show that when mobility rates are very low, as in this region, quarantine practices must be highly effective before they alter disease patterns significantly. Simulation results suggest, though, that effectiveness varies depending on when the limitation on travel between communities is implemented and how long it lasts, and that a policy of introducing quarantine at the earliest possible time may not always lead to the greatest reduction in cases of a disease.

   Pages = {91-115},
   Abstract = {Patterns of transmission of infectious diseases within and among populations are strongly affected by population structure, which can either facilitate or limit interactions among people from different groups, Results from several theoretical studies show that nonrandom mixing among subgroups can affect the time when an infectious disease is introduced to the population, the speed of propagation of the disease, and the severity of an epidemic, Because many of these models focus on the effects of population structure, they are functionally similar to models used to describe the genetic structure of a population, One major difference between genetic models and epidemic models is that genetic models, with a time scale of the order of generations, incorporate migrations (or permanent movement) among subgroups, whereas epidemic models, with a time scale of the order of days or weeks, must incorporate short- term mobility among subgroups, Such mobility can be included in models for epidemic spread by explicitly incorporating the process by which residents from different locations interact with one another. We present a derivation of a mobility model for epidemic processes and apply it to the spread of the 1918- 1919 influenza epidemic among the Cree and Metis people associated with three Hudson's Bay Company posts in the central Canadian Subarctic. The model distinguishes mobility from population effects. Results indicate that social organization (population effects) and social responses to the epidemic were more important than movement patterns (mobility) in explaining the differential impact of this virgin soil epidemic on the three study communities.},

   Journal = {Human Biology},
   Volume = {65},
   Number = {1},
   Pages = {107-129},
   Abstract = {Because of the short incubation period of most acute infectious diseases, short-term and daily mobility are more important than permanent and seasonal migration for the spread of these diseases. Yet most studies of population mobility focus on permanent or semipermanent change of residence. Here, we describe the results from a field study conducted on the island of Dominica, West Indies, during the summers of 1989 and 1990 and the winter of 1991. The study was designed to collect data on short-term mobility rather than migration. These mobility data are linked with data on the patterns of measles transmission during a 1984 epidemic. Three-hundred five individuals from all parts of the island were interviewed about their daily travel patterns, their travel off the island, and the travel of members of their immediate family. In addition to these respondents, interviews were conducted with representatives of most of the major occupations that involve travel in the course of a workday. Data were also collected on the number and type of motor vehicles traveling along various routes on the island and on travel of native residents to the capital city, Roseau, to buy or sell at the major,weekly market. Analysis of the interviews shows that travel within the island is clearly nonrandom. For example, almost everyone interviewed traveled to Roseau at least once a month, but 40% of the respondents had never been to any of the major villages in the Grand Bay Health District, which is only about a half- hour from Roseau. Patterns of disease transmission have been directly affected by these mobility patterns. The measles epidemic in 1984 apparently did not reach the Grand Bay Health District, even though all other areas of the island experienced significant rates of infection. Analysis of reasons for the relative isolation of the Grand Bay Health District indicates the importance of transportation patterns, as well as social, cultural, and geographic factors, to the disease transmission patterns throughout the island.},

It is designed to be useful even if the clean signal is contaminated with 100\% or more noise (signal to noise ratio less than or equal to zero).  The meghod is based on time delay ebmedding using coordinates generated by local low-pass filtering, which we call a {\it low-pass embedding.}  The singluar value decomposition is then used locally in ebmedding space to distinguish between the dynamics and the noise.
The algorithm is evaluated for chaotic signals generated by the Lorenz and R\"ossler systems, to which Gaussian white noise has been added.},

   Pages = {279--311},
   Abstract = {A normal-mode analysis for unstable modes is performed on a class of self-gravitating, rotating, and collisionless stellar disks with finite radius.  For the equilibrium disks, a family of rigorous velocity distiribution functions is found by a newly developed method.  These distribution functions contain three parameters to control the amount of the radial velocity dispersion, the systematic rotation, and the differential rotation.  By varying these parameters sequentially, the change of the stability characteristics is traced for the modes with the azimuthal wavenumbers 0, 1, and 2.  It is found that the stabilization of the bar mode becomes harder as the strength of the differential rotation is increased.  At the same time, some of the stable modes are also destabilized by the differential rotation, though they are not the type predicted by the conventional local density-wave theoreies.  By changing the amount of the systematic rotation while fixing the radial velocity dispersion, peculiar behaavior of the on-armed mnode previously reporte ina an $N$-body simulation of the Schmit-Miyamoto and isochone disks is also found in one of the present disks even with uniform rotation.  The winding sense of the pattern of all the unstable modes investigated, except for the one-armed mode, is found to be well correlated with the radial profile of systematic rotation.},

   Volume = {174},

   Pages = {109-117},
   Abstract = {There is accumulating evidence suggesting that children may drive the spread of influenza epidemics. The objective of this study was to quantify the lead time by age using laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A for the 1995/1996–2005/2006 seasons from Canadian communities and laboratory-confirmed hospital admissions for the H1N1/2009 pandemic strain. With alignment of the epidemic curves locally before aggregation of cases, slight age-specific differences in the timing of infection became apparent. For seasonal influenza, both the 10--19- and 20--29-year age groups peaked 1 week earlier than other age groups, while during the fall wave of the 2009 pandemic, infections peaked earlier among only the 10--19-year age group. In the H3N2 seasons, infections occurred an average of 3.9 (95\% confidence interval: 1.7, 6.1) days earlier in the 20–29-year age group than for youth aged 10--19 years, while during the fall pandemic wave, the 10--19-year age group had a statistically significant lead of 3 days compared with both younger children aged 4--9 years and adults aged 20--29 years (P < 0.0001). This analysis casts doubt on the hypothesis that younger school-age children actually lead influenza epidemic waves.},

Simple, one-line models can predict target vaccination coverage that will eradicate an infectious agent, whilst other questions require complex simulations of stochastic processes in space and time. This review introduces some simple ordinary differential equation models of mass vaccination that can be used to address important questions about the predicted impact of vaccination programmes. We show how to calculate the threshold vaccination coverage rate that will eradicate an infection, explore the impact of vaccine-induced immunity that wanes through time, and study the competitive interactions between vaccine susceptible and vaccine resistant strains of infectious agent.},

   Abstract = {For centuries, scientists have attempted to identify and document analytical laws that underlie 
physical phenomena in nature. Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding 
natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding 
analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed 
data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We 
demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various 
physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any 
prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, 
Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate 
accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more 
complex systems, gradually uncovering the “alphabet” used to describe those systems. },

Setting and participants Reviewers at a general medical journal. Interventions Attendance at a training workshop or reception of a self taught training package focusing on what editors want from reviewers and how to critically appraise randomised controlled trials. Main outcome measures Quality of reviews of three manuscripts sent to reviewers at four to six monthly intervals, evaluated using the validated review quality instrument; number of deliberate major errors identified; time taken to review the manuscripts; proportion recommending rejection of the manuscripts. Results Reviewers in the self taught group scored higher in review quality after training than did the control group (score 2.85 v 2. 6; difference 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.14 to 0.44; P = 0.001), but the difference was not of editorial significance and was not maintained in the long term. Both intervention groups identified significantly more major errors after training than did the control group (3.14 and 2.96 v 2.13; P < 0.001), and this remained significant after the reviewers' performance at baseline assessment was taken into account. The evidence for benefit of training was no longer apparent on further testing six months after the interventions. Training had no impact on the time taken to review the papers but was associated with an increased likelihood of recommending rejection (92% and 84% v 76%; P = 0.002).

   Abstract = {Despite the large body of evidence suggesting a beneficial role of fever in the host response, antipyretic therapy is commonly employed for febrile critically ill patients. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of antipyretic therapy strategies on the outcomes of critically ill patients. Patients admitted to the Trauma Intensive Care Unit over a nine-month period were eligible for inclusion, except those with traumatic brain injury. Patients were randomized on day three of the ICU stay into aggressive or permissive groups. The aggressive group received acetaminophen 650 mg every 6 h for temperature of >38.5 degrees C and a cooling blanket was added for temperature of >39.5 degrees C. The permissive group received no treatment for temperature of >38.5 degrees C, but instead had treatment initiated at temperature of >40 degrees C, at which time acetaminophen and cooling blankets were used until temperature was <40 degrees C. Patient demographics, daily temperatures, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) scores, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) scores, and infections and complications were recorded. Between December, 2002 and September, 2003, 572 patients were screened, of whom 82 met criteria for enrollment. Forty-four patients were randomized to the aggressive group and 38 patients were randomized to the permissive group for a total of 961 and 751 ICU days, respectively. There were 131 infections in the aggressive group and 85 infections in the permissive group (4 +/- 6 vs. 3 +/- 2 infections per patient, p = 0.26). There were seven deaths in the aggressive group and only one death in the permissive group (p = 0.06, Fisher Exact Test). The study was stopped after the first interim analysis due to the mortality difference, related to the issues of waiver of consent and the mandate for minimal risk. Aggressively treating fever in critically ill patients may lead to a higher mortality rate.},

   Abstract = {A sample numerical model has been computed for a triaxial stellar system in dynamical equilibrium.  A four-step procedure was employed.  (1)~A density distribution with a modified Hubble profile---to approximate elliptical galaxies---and axis ratios of $1:1.25:2$ was chosen.  This figure was further chosen not to rotate.  (2)~The potential corresponding to the chosen density distribution was computed.  (3)~About 1500 orbits were computed with this potential, one at a time, each covering typically 100 oscillations through the system., i.e., $\sim 1$ billion years.  These orbits belong to two familes, viz., box orbits and tube orbits around the long axis of the system.  (4)~A reproduction of the chosen density distribution---in terms of its mass in 285 cells in each octant---was sought by superposition of a subset of the available orbits, each populated by an appropriate, nonnegative number of stars.  The application of linear programming led to a numerical solution.  The main results are: First, the majority of the orbits computed in step~3 turned out to have three effective integrals, i.e., two nonclassical ones in addition to the energy integral.  Second, the existence of the numerical solution found in step~4 suggests the existence of triaxial self-consistent systems in dynamical equilibrium with density profiles fitting elliptical galaxies.},

   Abstract = {Multistrain diseases are diseases that consist of several strains, or serotypes. The serotypes may interact by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), in which infection with a single serotype is asymptomatic, but infection with a second serotype leads to serious illness accompanied by greater infectivity. It has been observed from serotype data of dengue hemorrhagic fever that outbreaks of the four serotypes occur asynchronously. Both autonomous and seasonally driven outbreaks were studied in a model containing ADE. For sufficiently small ADE, the number of infectives of each serotype synchronizes, with outbreaks occurring in phase. When the ADE increases past a threshold, the system becomes chaotic, and infectives of each serotype desynchronize. However, certain groupings of the primary and secondary infectives remain synchronized even in the chaotic regime.},

   Volume = {{}},
   Pages = {DOI:10.1503 /cmaj.111990},
   Abstract = {Background: Results of randomized controlled trials evaluating zinc for the treatment of the common cold are conflicting. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zinc for such use.
Methods: We searched electronic databases and other sources for studies published through to Sept. 30, 2011. We included all randomized controlled trials comparing orally administered zinc with placebo or no treatment. Assessment for study inclusion, data extraction and risk-of-bias analyses were performed in duplicate. We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model.
Results: We included 17 trials involving a total of 2121 participants. Compared with patients given placebo, those receiving zinc had a shorter duration of cold symptoms (mean difference --1.65 days, 95\% confidence interval [CI] --2.50 to --0.81); however, heterogeneity was high (I2 = 95\%). Zinc shortened the duration of cold symptoms in adults (mean difference --2.63, 95\% CI --3.69 to --1.58), but no significant effect was seen among children (mean difference --0.26, 95\% CI --0.78 to 0.25). Heterogeneity remained high in all subgroup analyses, including by age, dose of ionized zinc and zinc formulation. The occurrence of any adverse event (risk ratio [RR] 1.24, 95\% CI 1.05 to 1.46), bad taste (RR 1.65, 95\% CI 1.27 to 2.16) and nausea (RR 1.64, 95\% CI 1.19 to 2.27) were more common in the zinc group than in the placebo group.
Interpretation: The results of our meta-analysis showed that oral zinc formulations may shorten the duration of symptoms of the common cold. However, large high-quality trials are needed before definitive recommendations for clinical practice can be made. Adverse effects were common and should be the point of future study, because a good safety and tolerance profile is essential when treating this generally mild illness.},

   Pages = {245-252},
   Abstract = {Objective - To examine whether periodic variations in annual infant mortality were associated with malnutrition and the poor quality of the food supply available to the community. Design - Retrospective study of historical epidemiology of infant mortality by time series analysis and family reconstitution of parish registers of burials and baptisms. Setting - Penrith, Cumbria, England, 1557-1812. Subjects - A total of 17 500 births during 1557-1812. Results - This community in the Eden Valley, Cumbria, close to the Scottish borders, was living under marginal conditions with high mortality and low fertility. Clear oscillations in infant mortality synchronise with the oscillations in the wheat price index which is regarded as a measure of the availability of food to the community, and to pregnant and nursing mothers in particular. Input-output analysis showed that the relationship between the wheat price index (input) and infant mortality (output) was highly significant (p < 0.001). Events during the famine of 1623 have been analysed in detail: high wheat prices during pregnancy caused subsequent severe infant mortality but did not have indirect effects on the subsequent mortality of the surviving children over the age of 1 year. Non-stationary oscillations in neonatal and post neonatal mortality were strongly coherent (p < 0.001) with the wheat price index throughout the period. Conclusions - Infant mortality is particularly sensitive to famine and also to the quality of the food supply available to pregnant and nursing mothers. The lags between neonatal and post-neonatal mortalities and wheat prices, together with the analysis of the famine of 1623, support the hypothesis that neonatal mortality was related to malnutrition in pregnancy whereas post-neonatal mortality was primarily directly dependent on exogenous causes in the first year of Life.},

   Abstract = {Using a family reconstitution study the biology of the plague in Penrith, Cumbria in 1597/8 is described in detail; it was an explosive epidemic that spread rapidly within families and 606 individuals died of the plague, some 40% of the population. The age-specific mortality corresponded with the calculated age structure of the population and infection appeared to be random. The sex ratio of victims was 1.37 Females to 1 male. The plague spread From the northeast via Richmond and then exploded in the Eden valley, appearing almost simultaneously in Penrith, Kendal and Carlisle. The details of the epidemics and the location and climate of these widely separated small market towns show that bubonic plague was not the causative agent, and the possibility that anthrax was responsible for the drastic mortality is briefly considered. The population rapidly built up after the plague, largely by immigration and not by increased fertility, and steady-state conditions were re- established within 5 years and continued for 150 years. This severe mortality crisis of the plague had a profound effect on the population at Penrith, triggering long wavelength oscillations in both baptisms and burials in this population living under marginal conditions and maintained in steady-state by density-dependent factors.},

   Abstract = {The exogenous cycles and population dynamics of the community at Penrith, Cumbria, England, have been studied (1557-1812) using aggregative analysis, family reconstitution and time series analysis. This community was living under marginal conditions for the first 200 years and the evidence presented is of a homeostatic regime where famine, malnutrition and epidemic disease acted to regulate the balance between resources and population size. This provides an ideal historic population for an investigation of the direct and indirect effects of malnutrition. Throughout the period studied, a short wavelength oscillation in grain prices was apparently the major external factor that drove exogenous cycles in mortality, birth rate, and migration. In particular, the different responses of children to variations in food supply are emphasised; fluctuations in poor nutrition correlated significantly with the variations in mortality rates for infants (probably indirectly during pregnancy and directly during the first year of life) and for young children (via susceptibility to lethal infectious diseases). Migratory movements contributed to the maintenance of homeostasis in the population dynamics. A medium wavelength cycle in low winter temperatures was associated with a rise in adult mortality which, in turn, promoted an influx of migrants into this saturated habitat. A model incorporating these interacting associations between vital events and exogenous cycles is presented: grain prices were an important density-dependent factor and constituted the major component of the negative feedback of this population and drove the exogenous, short wavelength mortality cycles. Cycles of births and immigration provide a positive feedback for the build-up of susceptibles and the initiation of smallpox epidemics and increased population size.},

   Journal = {Disease Management and Health Outcomes},
   Volume = {11},
   Number = {4},
   Pages = {259-269},
   Abstract = {Introduction: Influenza is associated with illnesses such as pneumonia and other respiratory conditions and in severe cases leads to death. The prevalence of these illnesses and deaths fluctuates with the seasons during the year, even in the absence of influenza. Although many studies have focussed on mortality associated with influenza epidemics, and some have examined hospitalizations in elderly patients, there are very few studies that have examined the effect of influenza epidemics on adults or children. This study seeks to determine the association between general practitioner (GP) consultations for influenza-like illnesses and hospital admissions of adults and children associated with influenza epidemics. Methods: Structural Time Series Models with stochastic trend and seasonal components were developed for two age groups (children aged 0-15 years, and adults aged 16-50 years). Data from the Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network on GP consultation rates for influenza-like illnesses, and data from Swiss hospital admissions, were obtained for the period 1987-1996. The explanatory variables (i.e., the percentage of GP consultations for influenza-like illnesses and a 1-week lag of this variable) were modeled against hospital admission rates for pneumonia and influenza and other respiratory conditions. Excess hospitalizations were calculated as the difference between predicted hospital admissions during influenza epidemics and expected hospital admissions in the absence of influenza epidemics. Results: In these two age groups, there was an annual average of 1452 (range: 1000-1700) hospital admissions directly associated with influenza epidemics. Excess admission rates were substantially higher in children (pneumonia and influenza: 4.77 per 10 000 children per year, and other respiratory conditions: 2.29 per 10 000 children per year) compared with adults (pneumonia and influenza: 0.86 per 10 000 adults per year and other respiratory conditions: 0.68 per 10 000 adults per year). The models explained 56-84% of the variation in hospital admissions. The seasonal patterns were stable over the 10 years modeled and the variances of the trends were small. Conclusion: The structural time series models is an ideal approach to model influenza-related hospitalizations as the models capture trends, seasonal variation, and the association with exogenous factors.},

   Number = {1},
   Pages = {88-18},
   Abstract = {This paper provides an overview of epidemiological and demographic research linking social characteristics of both individuals and communities to differences in both morbidity and mortality risks. Evidence is presented linking three broad aspects of the social environment to health--the network of personal social relationships within which most of us live our lives, individual socioeconomic status (SES), and community-level social characteristics. Large and consistent bodies of literature from both epidemiology and demography provide clear evidence for the generally health-promoting effects of personal social relationships and SES. The bulk of the evidence relates to mortality although both fields have begun to examine other health outcomes, including aspects of physical and cognitive functioning as well as disease outcomes. A smaller but growing body of community-level data, reflecting both the socioeconomic/resource characteristics of these broader communities and, more specifically, social features of these environments, also point to health impacts from these more macro level social environment characteristics. Much remains to be elucidated, however, concerning the actual mechanisms through which something as complex and multifaceted as SES "gets under the skin." This necessarily includes consideration of external characteristics of the environments (both physical and sociocultural) where people live and work, and individual characteristics, as well as possible interactions between these in producing the observed SES gradients in health and mortality. These questions concerning links between social environment conditions and health may be a particularly fruitful area of future collaboration, drawing on the shared interest of demographers and epidemiologists in understanding how different social conditions promote variation in distributions of better versus worse health outcomes within a population.},

   Volume = {99},
   Pages = {362--374},
   Abstract = {Computer models are used to study the evolution of bar unstable stellar discs.  Two distinct stages of bar development are found to occur.  Firstly, a bar forms, as a result of the well-known ``bar-forming instability'', whose length is directly proportional to the turnover radius of the rotation curve of the initial disc.  The second stage is characterised by intermittent bar-driven spiral structure which allows the bar to grow further through transfer of angular momentum to stars in the outer parts of the disc.  This second process occurs only when a suitable cool population of stars is available to accept the angular momentum.  Growth of the bar ceases when this condition is no longer fulfilled.
The initial bars rotate fast enough to avoid inner Lindblad resonances and the pattern speed declines after their formation.  At all stages the bars end in the neighbourhood of corotation.  The stream flow of stars in the bar is well organised but highly non-circular.  The mean tangential velocity of stars measured along the bar major axis always rises steadily to a maximum at or just outside the end of the bar.
Finally, it is shown that numerical problems misled Berman and Mark (1979) to the erroneous conclusion that a small bulge component can prevent bar formation in a cool stellar disc.},

Two types of disc are studied: one in which all stars move initially on circular orbits and a second case in which stars have a broad distribution of initial velocities causing them individually to follow eccentric orbits.  Quiet start procedures are developed and found to be advisable for both cases.  The observed mode frequencies in the cold disc models are within 2\% of the linear theory values while discrepancies of $\sim 10\%$ arise in the warm disc models.  Nonquiet starts can lead to errors in excess of 50\% when the same number of particles is used.

Density fluctuations arising from tens of thousands of randomly distributed particles in $N$-body experiments are generally substantial enough to alter the predicted small amplitude behaviour drastically.  The differnt behaviour at finite amplitude is largely atributable to saturation at inner Lindblad resonances.},

   Abstract = {We present a description of spiral structure that appears to account for both the imperfect grand-design nature of the patterns and the importance of gas.  We argue that most visible spirals are short-lived features organized by gravitational forces.  The recurrent transient patterns are self-regulating since they cause the velocity dispersion of the stars to rise secularly until, in the absence of gas, the disk becomes stable.  However, {\it any\/} method of cooling will ensure that the disk will never completely stabilize and will, consequently, exhibit recurrent spiral structure.  Both dissipation in the gas and accretion will cool the disk and provoke instabilities.
We observe transient spiral patterns in computer simulations which recur repeatedly only when processes designed to mimic accretion and star formation are included.  Our models evolve at an equilibrium $Q$, implying that the rate of heating by the spirals balances the steady rate of cooling.  We also find that the growth of spiral patterns is in reasonable quantitative agreement with the prediction of ``swing amplification'' theory.  In a companion paper we show that this continous activity leads naturally to the type of age-velocity dispersion relation observed for the solar neighborhood stars.},

This difficulty can be avoided if the spiral arms have a lower pattern speed than the bar.  We present evidence of multiple pattern speeds in our $N$-body simulations, and show that, though the spiral continually breaks from and reconnects to the bar, the morphology of the pattern at all times resembles that of barred galaxies in the sky.  We briefly discuss how the gas might respond to the multiple patterns.},

Fewer staff who wore masks (p=0.0001), gowns (p=0.006), and washed their hands (p=0.047) became infected compared with those who didn't, but stepwise logistic regression was significant only for masks (p=0.011). Practice of droplets precaution and contact precaution is adequate in significantly reducing the risk of infection after exposures to patients with SARS.

A recent reanalysis of laboratory experiments indicates that absolute humidity strongly modulates the airborne survival and transmission of the influenza virus. Here, we extend these findings to the human population level, showing that the onset of increased wintertime influenza-related mortality in the United States is associated with anomalously low absolute humidity levels during the prior weeks. We then use an epidemiological model, in which observed absolute humidity conditions temper influenza transmission rates, to successfully simulate the seasonal cycle of observed influenza-related mortality. The model results indicate that direct modulation of influenza transmissibility by absolute humidity alone is sufficient to produce this observed seasonality. These findings provide epidemiological support for the hypothesis that absolute humidity drives seasonal variations of influenza transmission in temperate regions.},

The basis for this pronounced seasonality is not understood, nor is 
it well documented how inﬂuenza A transmission principally oc- 
curs. Previous studies indicate that relative humidity (RH) affects 
both inﬂuenza virus transmission (IVT) and inﬂuenza virus survival 
(IVS). Here, we reanalyze these data to explore the effects of 
absolute humidity on IVT and IVS. We ﬁnd that absolute humidity 
(AH) constrains both transmission efﬁciency and IVS much more 
signiﬁcantly than RH. In the studies presented, 50% of IVT vari- 
ability and 90% of IVS variability are explained by AH, whereas, 
respectively, only 12% and 36% are explained by RH. In temperate 
regions, both outdoor and indoor AH possess a strong seasonal 
cycle that minimizes in winter. This seasonal cycle is consistent with 
a wintertime increase in IVS and IVT and may explain the season- 
ality of inﬂuenza. Thus, differences in AH provide a single, coher- 
ent, more physically sound explanation for the observed variability 
of IVS, IVT and inﬂuenza seasonality in temperate regions. This 
hypothesis can be further tested through future, additional labo- 
ratory, epidemiological and modeling studies. },

   Pages = {201-207},
   Abstract = {Of the unexplained characteristics of the 1918-19 influenza pandemic, the extreme mortality rate among young adults (W-shaped mortality curve) is the foremost. Lack of a coherent explanation of this and other epidemiologic and clinical manifestations of the pandemic contributes to uncertainty in preparing for future pandemics. Contemporaneous records suggest that immunopathologic responses were a critical determinant of the high mortality rate among young adults and other high-risk subgroups. Historical records and findings from laboratory animal studies suggest that persons who were exposed to influenza once before 1918 (e.g., A/H3Nx 1890 pandemic strain) were likely to have dysregulated, pathologic cellular immune responses to infections with the A/H1N1 1918 pandemic strain. The immunopathologic effects transiently increased susceptibility to ultimately lethal secondary bacterial pneumonia. The extreme mortality rate associated with the 1918-19 pandemic is unlikely to recur naturally. However, T-cell-mediated immunopathologic effects should be carefully monitored in developing and using universal influenza vaccines.},

   Abstract = {The 1918 to 1919 "Spanish" influenza pandemic virus killed up to 50 million people. We report here clinical, pathological, bacteriological, and virological findings in 68 fatal American influenza/pneumonia military patients dying between May and October of 1918, a period that includes similar to 4 mo before the 1918 pandemic was recognized, and 2 mo (September-October 1918) during which it appeared and peaked. The lung tissues of 37 of these cases were positive for influenza viral antigens or viral RNA, including four from the prepandemic period (May-August). The prepandemic and pandemic peak cases were indistinguishable clinically and pathologically. All 68 cases had histological evidence of bacterial pneumonia, and 94\% showed abundant bacteria on Gram stain. Sequence analysis of the viral hemagglutinin receptor-binding domain performed on RNA from 13 cases suggested a trend from a more "avian-like" viral receptor specificity with G222 in prepandemic cases to a more "human-like" specificity associated with D222 in pandemic peak cases. Viral antigen distribution in the respiratory tree, however, was not apparently different between prepandemic and pandemic peak cases, or between infections with viruses bearing different receptor-binding polymorphisms. The 1918 pandemic virus was circulating for at least 4 mo in the United States before it was recognized epidemiologically in September 1918. The causes of the unusually high mortality in the 1918 pandemic were not explained by the pathological and virological parameters examined. These findings have important implications for understanding the origins and evolution of pandemic influenza viruses.},

   Volume = {224},
   Number = {4},
   Pages = {251-256},
   Abstract = {Influenza epidemics occur periodically during the winter season in temperate areas. Characteristic features of winter include low temperature and low humidity. Humidity is expressed in two different ways: absolute humidity (AH) defined as absolute amount of water in the air, and relative humidity (RH) defined as the relative proportion of water in the air in comparison to the maximum water vapor. There have been many arguments for RH as a determinant factor for influenza epidemics. On the other hand, we have been putting emphasis on AH on the basis of our epidemiological observations. In this context, a recent experimental and theoretical study by other investigators has shown that AH correlates with influenza survival, transmission, and seasonality. Accordingly, we collected meteorological and influenza epidemiological data from 46 prefectures in temperate Japan for 1991--1995 and 1999--2009, and analyzed 2,392 sets of weekly compiled data for each season year by using multiple linear regression analysis, in which the numbers of influenza cases were regarded as a function of AH and RH. We found that the standardized partial regression coefficient for AH was consistently stronger than that for RH with statistical significance. In addition, AH increased and decreased significantly at the time of the epidemic onset and subsidence in seven and twelve out of fourteen influenza seasons, respectively, whereas RH did so in none and two out of fourteen influenza seasons. Thus, we have substantiated our quarter-century-old assertion that AH strongly correlates with the onset and subsidence of influenza epidemics.},

   Volume = {358},
   Pages = {495--514},
   Abstract = {Motivated by a recent study that discovered a new type of eccentric (i.e., $m=1$) gravitational instability in nearly Keplerian disks, we present an analytical description of the relevant modal mechanisms.  Using a WKBJ analysis, we derive a quantum condition which accurately predicts the pattern speeds (i.e., the real part of the eigenfrequencies) for these modes.  One unique aspect of $m=1$ modes is that the center of mass of the perturbation in the disk does not lie at the geometrical center of the system; hence, the star is displaced from the center of mass and creates an effective forcing potential---the ``indirect potential.''  We determine the growth rates for the modes under the illustrative assumption that all of the amplification arises from the coupling of the indirect term to the outer Lindblad resonance in the disk, and that the indirect term arises mostly near the outer disk edge.  We find that these modes can grow when the disk is safely stable to axisymmetric disturbances (Toomre's $Q$ substantially greater than unity), and we discuss the case of marginal stability for these modes.  We also find that the exact spectrum of unstable modes can depend on the details of the motion of the outside edge.  As a benchmark, we introduce the concept of the ``maximum solar nebula,'' which corresponds to the maximum disk mass (relative to the star mass) that remains stable to {\sl all\/} gravitational modes.  Finally, we discuss the implications of the considerations for the formation of binary companions and/or giant planets within the disks associated with young stellar objects.},

   Abstract = {In July, 1994, in one of the worst cholera outbreaks in recent times, an estimated 12 000 Rwandan refugees died in Goma in eastern Zaire, The Vibrio cholerae strains were resistant to tetracycline and doxycycline, the commonly used drugs for cholera treatment. Despite the efforts of international organisations, which provided medical relief by establishing treatment centres in Goma, mortality from the disease was much higher than expected. In the area of Muganga camp, which had the largest concentration of refugees and where most of the medical aid organisations were active, the highest reported case-fatality ratio for a single day was 48%. The slow rate of rehydration, inadequate use of oral rehydration therapy, use of inappropriate intravenous fluids, and inadequate experience of health workers in management of severe cholera are thought to be some of the factors associated with the failure to prevent so many deaths during the epidemic. In one of the temporary treatment centres with the worst case-fatality record, our team showed that improvement of these factors could increase the odds of survival of cholera patients even in a disaster setting.},

   Abstract = {Evaluation of potential influenza virus inhibitors may utilize multiple steps. First would be to determine if the viral target (e.g. influenza virus neuraminidase) being focused upon will be inhibited in the appropriate assay. Standard in vitro antiviral assays, used next in antiviral evaluations, may utilize inhibition of viral plaques, viral cytopathic effect (CPE), and viral hemagglutinin or other protein, with inhibition of viral yield used in follow-up evaluations. The CPE can be determined visually and by dye uptake, Animal models used for study of potential influenza virus inhibitors include the ferret, the laboratory mouse, and the chicken, with a variety of parameters used to indicate the severity of the infection and its inhibition by therapy. Multiple parameters are recommended in any in vivo antiviral evaluation. The ferret and the mouse infection models have been useful in studying the development of drug resistance and the relative virulence of drug-resistant viruses. The influenza mouse model has also been of value for the evaluation of immunomodulating effects of test compounds and for the study of the utility of antiviral drugs for use against influenza virus infections in the immunocompromised host. In considering the use of any animal model, species differences in drug pharmacology and metabolism must be taken into account. This review has described the systems which have been used most frequently by antiviral investigators, using, as examples, recent studies with the clinically approved influenza virus neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. },

A stability criterion is obtained based on the computation of the transversal Liapunov number of attractors on the synchronous invariant manifold. We examine in detail a special case of density-dependent dispersal rule where migration does not occur if the patch density is below a certain critical density, while the fraction of individuals that migrate to other patches is kept constant if the patch density is above the threshold level. Comparisons with density-independent migration models indicate that this simple density-dependent dispersal mechanism reduces the stability of synchronous dynamics. We were able to quantify exactly this loss of stability through the frequency that synchronous trajectories are above the critical density.},

   Abstract = {Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently used antipyretic agents that most probably exert their antifever effect by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. Thus, COX-2-selective drugs or null mutation of the COX-2 gene reduce or prevent fever. Acetaminophen is antipyretic and analgesic, as are NSAIDs, but it lacks the anti-inflammatory and anticoagulatory properties of these drugs. This has led to the speculation that a COX variant exists that is inhibitable by acetaminophen. An acetaminophen-inhibitable enzyme is inducible in the mouse J774.2 monocyte cell line. Induction of acetaminophen-inhibitable prostaglandin E-2 synthesis parallels induction of COX-2. Thus, inhibition of pharmacologically distinct COX-2 enzyme activity by acetaminophen may be the mechanism of action of this important antipyretic drug.},

   Journal = {INternational Congress Series},
   Volume = {1219},
   Pages = {13-19},
   Abstract = {More than 20% of all childhood deaths are thought to be acute respiratory (ARI) deaths; most of these occur in developing countries. Bacterial pathogens are implied in 70–90% of pediatric ARI deaths, while 10–30% are attributed to respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV). This implies that influenza is not an important cause of severe pediatric ARI.
Influenza A,B virus infections may nevertheless cause ARI deaths by triggering bacterial superinfections. The mechanism of triggering is still poorly understood, as well as the consequences in terms of disease burden. However, recent studies have shed additional light on the triggering mechanism and provided an example of an influenza-triggered outbreak of severe pediatric pneumococcal disease. Further, new studies have quantified the impact of influenza on pediatric hospitalizations in the US—and argued that they may be similar in magnitude to that of RSV.
In the tropics, the year-round circulation of influenza viruses prohibits the use of traditional tools to observe and quantify the attributable burden as the increase in severe ARI outcomes during influenza periods. Also, several studies of pathogens isolated from ARI-hospitalized children suggest a minor role of influenza viruses. However, since influenza may trigger bacterial super infections it is likely that undiagnosed influenza infections cause a significant subset of ARI deaths in developing countries.
The void of data demonstrating the impact on ARI hospitalizations and deaths in the tropics has put influenza viruses at a disadvantage in terms of being recognized as serious pathogens. With the availability of new mucosal live-attenuated influenza vaccine formulations, it may be prudent to re-examine this issue for children living in tropical developing countries. Vaccine probe studies are needed to assess the true influenza-related disease burden.},

   Abstract = {Objectives; The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of recent influenza epidemics on mortality in the United States and to develop an index for comparing the severity of individual epidemics. Methods. A cyclical regression model was applied to weekly national vital statistics from 1972 through 1992 to estimate excesses in pneumonia and influenza mortality and all-cause mortality for each influenza season. Each season was categorized on the basis of increments of 2000 pneumonia and influenza excess deaths, and each of these severity categories was correlated with a range of all-cause excess mortality. Results. Each of the 20 influenza seasons studied was associated with an average of 5600 pneumonia and influenza excess deaths (range, 0-11 800) and 21 300 all-cause excess deaths (range, 0-47 200). Most influenza A(H3N2) seasons fell into severity categories 4 to 6 (23 000-45 000 all-cause excess deaths), whereas most A(H1N1) and B seasons were ranked in categories 1 to 3 (0-23 000 such deaths). Conclusions. From 1972 through 1992, influenza epidemics accounted for a total of 426 000 deaths in the United States, many times more then those associated with recent pandemics. The influenza epidemic severity index was useful for categorizing severity and provided improved seasonal estimates of the total number of influenza-related deaths.},

This study compared the age distribution of influenza-related deaths in the United States during this century's three influenza A pandemics with that of the following epidemics. Half of influenza-related deaths during the 1968-1969 influenza A (H3N2) pandemic and large proportions of influenza-related deaths during the 1957- 1958 influenza A (H2N2) and the 1918-1919 influenza A (H1N1) pandemics occurred among persons <65 years old. However, this group accounted for decrementally smaller proportions of deaths during the first decade following each pandemic, A model suggested that this mortality pattern may be explained by selective acquisition of protection against fatal illness among younger persons. The large proportion of influenza-related deaths during each pandemic and the following decade among persons <65 years old should be considered in planning for pandemics.},

Employing data from field surveys in 1985-1987 and 1995, we use spatial statistical methodologies linked to a geographical information system (GIS) to describe the patterns of human settlement in the area, the ecological transformations induced by forest clearance practices, and the manner in which these factors determine gradations of malaria risk. Our findings show that land use patterns, linked to social organization of the community and the structure of the physical environment, played a key role in promoting malaria transmission. In addition, the location of each occupied area is itself an important determinant of the pattern of malaria risk. Based on lessons learned from our spatial and temporal characterization of malaria risk, we propose policies for malaria mitigation in the Brazilian Amazon.},

Furthermore, many risk factors for chronic diseases show improvements, many linked to education, from 1910 to the present. Projections indicate the proportion of persons aged 85-89 with less than 8 years of education will decline from 65% in 1980 to 15% in 2015. Health and socioeconomic status trends are not directly represented in Medicare Trust Fund and Social Security Administration beneficiary projections. Thus, they may have different economic implications from projections directly accounting for health trends. A 1.5% annual disability decline keeps the support ratio (ratio of economically active persons aged 20-64 to the number of chronically disabled persons aged 65+) above its 1994value, 22:1, when the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund was in fiscal balance, to 2070. With no changes in disability, projections indicate a support ratio in 2070 of 8:1-63% below a cash flow balance.},

   Abstract = {From uncertain origins in the spring of 1918, an apparently new variant of influenza A virus spread around the world as three distinct diffusion waves, infecting half a billion and probably killing around 40 million people. This paper examines the spatial structure of influenza transmission during the ten- month course of the epidemic in England and Wales, June 1918- April 1919, using the weekly counts of influenza deaths in London and the county boroughs as collated by the General Register Office, London. In addition, a particular case study of the borough of Cambridge is presented. From mid-1916, Cambridge contained, as well as its undergraduate population, a large naval contingent billeted in both the colleges and the town. It therefore affords the opportunity of studying the effect of the epidemic in contiguous groups with widely differing demographic characteristics. Through the application of a range of statistical methods (average lags, correlations and regressions), it is shown that the three waves that comprised the pandemic had fundamentally different spatial and temporal characteristics. The first, moving through a population that was a virgin soil to the new virus strain, was explosive in its north to south progress across the country. The second wave was somewhat slower in its rate of diffusion and displayed a south to north drift. Finally, the third wave reverted more closely to the form of the first. The spread of all three waves, however, was underpinned by a clearly defined process of spatial contagion. The Cambridge study showed the special characteristics of this pandemic in terms of the ages of those attacked: high rates were experienced across the age spectrum, a feature also seen internationally.},

   Abstract = {The effects of errors in numerical integration of the $N$-body equations of motion by a conventional technique have been studied differentially for systems containing 16 equal masses intially in virial equilibrium, with the calculations made from the same 5 sets of initial conditions with different accuracy.  The initial conditions were uniform density inside a sphere of unit radius and a step-function velocity distribution.  The sets of initial conditions differ in the random numbers chosen for positions and velocities of the individual particles.  Most of the calculations spanned the first three initial mean relaxation times.  As found previously by Miller (1964), the individual coordinates (positions and velocities) rapidly ``go wrong'' in some cases, especially at low accuracy.  However, the growth of the errors does not seem to be simply exponential as Miller claimed.  Most importantly, the calculations of this study reveal no significant differences in the statistical quantities describing the overall characteristics of the systems (density and energy distributions) for integrations of different accuracy.  The differences are insignificant even after the systems' ``memories'' of their detailed initial conditions have been erased by the errors, so long as the calculated system has not diverged.  Divergence of the system is identifiable by strong (\ie factor of $10^1$--$10^2$) violation of conservation of energy.  In view of this result, the most efficient use of a limited amount of computer time is to integrate a large number of different examples (\ie having different initial conditions) at relatively low accuracy.},

We quantified spatial variation in transmission rates associated with human demography and key habitat features. We found that large rivers act as semipermeable barriers, leading to a 7-fold reduction in the local rates of propagation. By combining the spatial distribution of major rivers with long-distance dispersal we were able to account for the observed irregular pattern of disease spread across the state without recourse to direct assessment of host-pathogen populations.},

We show that classic formulas approximate the expected number of mosquitoes that could trace infection back to one mosquito after one parasite generation, Z0(H), but they overestimate the expected number of infected humans per infected human, R0(H). Heterogeneous biting increases R0 and, as we show, Z0(H), but we also show that it sometimes reduces R0(H); those who are bitten most both infect many vectors and absorb infectious bites. The large range of R0 estimates strongly supports the long-held notion that malaria control presents variable challenges across its transmission spectrum. In populations where R0 is highest, malaria control will require multiple, integrated methods that target those who are bitten most. Therefore, strategic planning for malaria control should consider R0, the spatial scale of transmission, human population density, and heterogeneous biting.},

   Journal = {Science},
   Volume = {327},
   Pages = {697-701},
   Abstract = {Over the past two decades, HIV resistance to antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) has risen to high levels in the wealthier countries of the world, which are able to afford widespread treatment. We have gained insights into the evolution and transmission dynamics of ARV resistance by designing a biologically complex multistrain network model. With this model, we traced the evolutionary history of ARV resistance in San Francisco and predict its future dynamics. By using classification and regression trees, we identified the key immunologic, virologic, and treatment factors that increase ARV resistance.
Our modeling shows that 60\% of the currently circulating ARV-resistant strains in San Francisco are capable of causing self-sustaining epidemics, because each individual infected with one of these strains can cause, on average, more than one new resistant infection. It is possible that a new wave of ARV-resistant strains that pose a substantial threat to global public health is emerging.},

   Abstract = {To characterize the change in frequency of infectious disease outbreaks over time worldwide, we encoded and analysed a novel 33-year dataset (1980-2013) of 12,102 outbreaks of 215 human infectious diseases, comprising more than 44 million cases occuring in 219 nations. We merged these records with ecological characteristics of the causal pathogens to examine global temporal trends in the total number of outbreaks, disease richness (number of unique diseases), disease diversity (richness and outbreak evenness) and per capita cases. Bacteria, viruses, zoonotic diseases (originating in animals) and those caused by pathogens transmitted by vector hosts were responsible for the majority of outbreaks in our dataset. After controlling for disease surveillance, communications, geography and host availability, we find the total number and diversity of outbreaks, and richness of causal diseases increased significantly since 1980 (p < 0.0001). When we incorporate Internet usage into the model to control for biased reporting of outbreaks (starting 1990), the overall number of outbreaks and disease richness still increase significantly with time (p < 0.0001), but per capita cases decrease significantly ( p = 0.005). Temporal trends in outbreaks differ based on the causal pathogen's taxonomy, host requirements and transmission mode. We discuss our preliminary findings in the context of global disease emergence and surveillance.},

Davis, J. R., Smith, A. J., Miller, C. L. \& Allchin, A. (1979) Lancet i, 33-35] concluded that repeat vaccination was not protective in the long term, whereas the Keitel study [Keitel, W. A., Cate, T. R., Couch, R. B., Huggins,
L. L. \& Hess, K. R. (1997) Vaccine 15, 1114-1122] concluded that repeat vaccination provided continual protection. We propose an explanation, the antigenic distance hypothesis, and test it by analyzing seven influenza
outbreaks that occurred during the Hoskins and Keitel studies. The hypothesis is that variation in repeat vaccine efficacy is due to differences in antigenic distances among vaccine strains and between the vaccine strains and the
epidemic strain in each outbreak. To test the hypothesis, antigenic distances were calculated from historical hemagglutination inhibition assay tables, and a computer model of the immune response was used to predict the vaccine
efficacy of individuals given different vaccinations. The model accurately predicted the observed vaccine efficacies in repeat vaccinees relative to the efficacy in first-time vaccinees (correlation 0.87). Thus, the antigenic distance
hypothesis offers a parsimonious explanation of the differences between and within the Hoskins and Keitel studies. These results have implications for the selection of influenza vaccine strains, and also for vaccination strategies for
other antigenically variable pathogens that might require repeated vaccination.},

   Abstract = {Hundreds of thousands of people worldwide live or work in close proximity to steel mills.

Previous investigations of herring gulls in the Great Lakes demonstrated elevated DNA mutation rates near steel mills (3, 4) but could not determine the importance of airborne or aquatic routes of contaminant exposure, or eliminate possible confounding factors such as nutritional status and disease burden. To address these issues experimentally, we exposed laboratory mice in situ to ambient air in a polluted industrial area near steel mills. Heritable mutation frequency at tandem-repeat DNA loci in mice exposed 1 km downwind from two integrated steel mills was 1.5- to 2.0-fold elevated compared with those at a reference site 30 km away. This statistically significant elevation was due primarily to an increase in mutations inherited through the paternal germline. Our results indicate that human and wildlife populations in proximity to integrated steel mills may be at risk of developing germline mutations more frequently because of the inhalation of airborne chemical mutagens.},

   Pages = {392-5},
   Abstract = {Complex networks have been studied extensively owing to their relevance to many real systems such as the world-wide web, the Internet, energy landscapes and biological and social networks. A large number of real networks are referred to as 'scale-free' because they show a power-law distribution of the number of links per node. However, it is widely believed that complex networks are not invariant or self-similar under a length-scale transformation. This conclusion originates from the 'small-world' property of these networks, which implies that the number of nodes increases exponentially with the 'diameter' of the network, rather than the power-law relation expected for a self-similar structure. Here we analyse a variety of real complex networks and find that, on the contrary, they consist of self-repeating patterns on all length scales. This result is achieved by the application of a renormalization procedure that coarse-grains the system into boxes containing nodes within a given 'size'. We identify a power-law relation between the number of boxes needed to cover the network and the size of the box, defining a finite self-similar exponent. These fundamental properties help to explain the scale-free nature of complex networks and suggest a common self-organization dynamics.},

In the 1962 epidemic the rate increased to 41%. Among reinfected soldiers studied, 68% had an asymptomatic infection; only 10% were severely symptomatic, and they were found to be infected with a virus closely related to A/Asian/57. For H3N2 epidemics, the rate of reinfection was 17% among students studied in 1970 who were reinfected with a virus closely related to the prototype A/Hong Kong/68 (H3N2). Reinfection with an extremely drifted variant of H3N2 was found to be 32% and 69% in two groups of students studied in 1972. Reinfection with a related virus was 32% in another group studied in 1983. Among the students studied who were reinfected with H3N2 viruses, the rates of asymptomatic infection were similar to those of symptomatic infection.

   Abstract = {Many kinds of complex systems exhibit characteristic patterns of temporal correlations that emerge as the result of functional interactions within a structured network. One such complex system is the brain, composed of numerous neuronal units linked by synaptic connections. The activity of these neuronal units gives rise to dynamic states that are characterized by specific patterns of neuronal activation and co-activation. These patterns, called functional connectivity, are possible neural correlates of perceptual and cognitive processes. Which functional connectivity patterns arise depends on the anatomical structure of the underlying network, which in turn is modified by a broad range of activity-dependent processes. Given this intricate relationship between structure and function, the question of how patterns of anatomical connectivity constrain or determine dynamical patterns is of considerable theoretical importance. The present study develops computational tools to analyze networks in terms of their structure and dynamics. We identify different classes of network, including networks that are characterized by high complexity. These highly complex networks have distinct structural characteristics such as clustered connectivity and short wiring length similar to those of large-scale networks of the cerebral cortex. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

   Abstract = {Background. Improved understanding of human breast cancer growth rates may have many clinical applications. Previous reports have used small numbers of patients and assumed an exponential growth rate.
Methods. The exponential equation and the most commonly used decelerating growth equations, the Gompertz equation and seven generalized forms of the logistic equation, were fitted to mammographic measurements of primary breast cancer using the least squares method. An average of 3.4 observations was made in 113 patients, whereas two measurements were made in another 335 patients. Tumors were assumed to originate as a single cell with the lethal tumor volume assumed to be 240 cells.
Results. All decelerating equations tested provided a better fit than the exponential, whereas a form of the logistic equation provided the best fit to the data. Limitations in the number of tumor measurements, the assumption of maximal tumor size, and biases inherent in the method of data collection are reviewed. These observations suggest families of curves that characterize breast cancer growth during the early period of clinical observation.
Conclusions. Breast cancer growth in the early clinical period was modeled by a form of the logistic equation. The exponential equation fit the data least well.},

   Abstract = {The high case-fatality rate-especially among young adults-during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic is incompletely understood. Although late deaths showed bacterial pneumonia, early deaths exhibited extremely "wet," sometimes hemorrhagic lungs. The hypothesis presented herein is that aspirin contributed to the incidence and severity of viral pathology, bacterial infection, and death, because physicians of the day were unaware that the regimens (8.0-31.2 g per day) produce levels associated with hyperventilation and pulmonary edema in 33\% and 3\% of recipients, respectively. Recently, pulmonary edema was found at autopsy in 46\% of 26 salicylate-intoxicated adults. Experimentally, salicylates increase lung fluid and protein levels and impair mucociliary clearance. In 1918, the US Surgeon General, the US Navy, and the Journal of the American Medical Association recommended use of aspirin just before the October death spike. If these recommendations were followed, and if pulmonary edema occurred in 3\% of persons, a significant proportion of the deaths may be attributable to aspirin.},

   Abstract = {Oscillations are surprisingly common in the immune system, both in its healthy state and in disease. The most famous example is that of periodic fevers caused by the malaria parasite. A number of hereditary disorders, which also cause periodic fevers, have also been known for a long time. Various reports of oscillations in cytokine concentrations following antigen challenge have been published over at least the past three decades. Oscillations can also occur at the intracellular level. Calcium oscillations following T- cell activation are familiar to all immunologists, and metabolic and reactive oxygen species oscillations in neutrophils have been well documented. More recently, oscillations in nuclear factor kappa B activity following stimulation by tumor necrosis factor alpha have received considerable publicity. However, despite all of these examples, oscillations in the immune system still tend to be considered mainly as pathological aberrations, and their causes and significance remained largely unknown. This is partly because of a lack of awareness within the immunological community of the appropriate theoretical frameworks for describing and analyzing such behavior. We provide an introduction to these frameworks and give a survey of the currently known oscillations that occur within the immune system.},

   Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between nurse staffing levels and the rate of nosocomial viral gastrointestinal infections (NVGIs) in a general pediatrics population. DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive study. SETTING: A general pediatrics ward at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, a 320-bed, tertiary-care pediatric institution. RESULTS: Forty-three NVGIs were detected in 37 patients of 2,929 admissions (1.3%). The monthly NVGI rate correlated significantly with the monthly night patient-to-nurse ratio (r = 0.56) and the monthly day patient-to-nurse ratio (r = 0.50). The nursing hours per patient-day during the preinfection period (PIP) were significantly lower than those during the nonpreinfection period (NPIP; 12.5 vs 13.0). There was no difference between the PHI and the NPIP day patient-to-nurse ratios (3.31 vs 3.32), but there was a significant difference between the PIP and the NPIP night patient-to-nurse ratios (3.26 vs 3.16). The incidence of NVGIs in the 72-hour period after any day when the nursing hours per patient-day were less than 10.5 was 6.39 infections per 1,000 patient-days, compared with 2.17 infections per 1,000 patient-days in periods with more than 10.5 nursing hours per patient-day (rate ratio, 2.94; 95% confidence interval, 2.16 to 4.01). CONCLUSION: Nurse understaffing contributed to an increased NVGI rate in our general pediatrics population, and should be assessed as a risk factor in outbreak investigations},

   Volume = {2},
   Number = {4},
   Pages = {609-646},
   Abstract = {A coupled cell system is a network of dynamical systems, or "cells," coupled together. Such systems can be represented schematically by a directed graph whose nodes correspond to cells and whose edges represent couplings. A symmetry of a coupled cell system is a permutation of the cells that preserves all internal dynamics and all couplings. Symmetry can lead to patterns of synchronized cells, rotating waves, multirhythms, and synchronized chaos. We ask whether symmetry is the only mechanism that can create such states in a coupled cell system and show that it is not.  The key idea is to replace the symmetry group by the symmetry groupoid, which encodes information about the input sets of cells. (The input set of a cell consists of that cell and all cells connected to that cell.) The admissible vector fields for a given graph---the dynamical systems with the corresponding internal dynamics and couplings---are precisely those that are equivariant under the symmetry groupoid. A pattern of synchrony is "robust" if it arises for all admissible vector fields. The first main result shows that robust patterns of synchrony (invariance of "polydiagonal" subspaces under all admissible vector fields) are equivalent to the combinatorial condition that an equivalence relation on cells is "balanced." The second main result shows that admissible vector fields restricted to polydiagonal subspaces are themselves admissible vector fields for a new coupled cell network, the "quotient network." The existence of quotient networks has surprising implications fo!  r synchronous dynamics in coupled cell systems.},

The model was used to consider several treatment and chemoprophylaxis strategies and to determine their effects on the spread of the infection. The model predicts frequent emergence and transmission of drug- resistant viruses with certain treatment scenarios. According to the model, chemoprophylaxis of susceptible persons (without treatment of those who are symptomatic) may be the best way to reduce the force of an epidemic and to keep development of drug resistance low. The model predictions indicate that the relative transmissibility of resistant variants compared with wild type virus and the choice of the treatment or chemoprophylaxis strategy can be decisive for the spread of drug-resistant viruses, a feature that may be crucial in a pandemic.},

The network unites laboratories with different methods and capacities to rapidly fulfil all postulates for establishing a virus as the cause of a disease. Results are shared in real time via a secure website, on which microscopy pictures, protocols for testing, and PCR primer sequences are also posted. Findings are discussed in daily teleconferences. Progress is further facilitated through sharing between laboratories of samples and test materials. The network has identified a new coronavirus, consistently detected in samples of SARS patients from several countries, and conclusively named it as the causative agent of SARS; the strain Is unlike any other known member of the genus Coronavirus.

We show that repeatedly vaccinating the susceptible population in a series of "pulses," it is possible to eradicate the measles infection from the entire model population. We derive the conditions for epidemic eradication under various constraints and show their dependence on the parameters of the epidemic model. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Number = {7135},
   Pages = {533-536},
   Abstract = {Seasonality is a driving force that has a major effect on the spatiotemporal dynamics of natural systems and their populations(1-5). This is especially true for the transmission of common infectious diseases ( such as influenza, measles, chickenpox and pertussis), and is of great relevance for host-parasite relationships in general(1-23). Here we gain further insights into the nonlinear dynamics of recurrent diseases through the analysis of the classical seasonally forced SIR ( susceptible, infectious or recovered) epidemic model(6,7). Ouranalysis differs from other modelling studies in that the focus is more on post-epidemic dynamics than the outbreak itself. Despite the mathematical intractability of the forced SIR model, we identify a new threshold effect and give clear analytical conditions for predicting the occurrence of either a future epidemic outbreak, or a 'skip'-a year in which an epidemic fails to initiate. The threshold is determined by the population's susceptibility measured after the last outbreak and the rate at which new susceptible individuals are recruited into the population. Moreover, the time of occurrence ( that is, the phase) of an outbreak proves to be a useful parameter that carries important epidemiological information. In forced systems, seasonal changes can prevent late-peaking diseases ( that is, those having high phase) from spreading widely, thereby increasing population susceptibility, and controlling the triggering and intensity of future epidemics. These principles yield forecasting tools that should have relevance for the study of newly emerging and re-emerging diseases controlled by seasonal vectors.},

   Abstract = {A method is described for detecting the presence of nonlinearity in ecological and epidemiological time series. We make use of a nonlinear-prediction technique to probe data-sets for evidence of temporal directionality, and take advantage of the fact that the predictive properties of a signal generated from a stochastic linear Gaussian process as it evolves forwards in time, are exactly the same as when the signal is temporally reversed. In contrast nonlinear, and in particular chaotic processes, often fail to display such time reversibility. Hence one need only check for time directionality in order to test the null hypothesis that the erratic fluctuations in a time series are generated by a linear gaussian process. Strong evidence of time reversibility forces us to reject the null hypothesis and suggests that nonlinear dynamics play an important role. The method is tested on various model and real ecological time series.},

   Abstract = {We explore a method for automatic morphological classification of galaxies by Artificial Neural Network algorithm.  The method is illustrated using 13 galaxy parameters measured by machine (ESO-LV), and classification into 5 types (E, S0, Sa$+$Sb, Sc$+$Sd and Irr).  A simple Backpropagation algorithm allowed us to train a Network on a subset of the catalogue according to the catalogue human classification, and then to predict, using the measured parameters, the classification for the rest of the catalogue.  We show that the Nural NEtwork behaves in our problem as a Bayesian classifier, i.e., it assigns the {\it a posteriori\/} probability for each of the 5 classes considered.  The Network highest probability choice agrees with the catalogue classification for 64\% of the galaxies.  If either the first or the second highests probability choice of the Network is considered, the successs rate is 90\%.  The technique allows production of uniform and more objective classification of very large extragalactic data sets.},

from symmetry arguments that there should be a fourth fundamental element, which he called a memristor (short for memory resistor)1. Although he showed that such an element has many 
interesting and valuable circuit properties, until now no one has presented either a useful physical model or an example of a memristor. Here we show, using a simple analytical example, that memristance arises naturally in nanoscale systems in which solid-state electronic and ionic transport are coupled under an external bias voltage. These results serve as the foundation for understanding a wide range of hysteretic current–voltage behaviour observed in many nanoscale electronic devices 2–19 that involve the motion of charged atomic or molecular species, in particular certain titanium dioxide cross-point switches 20–22. },

   Abstract = {In 1997, 18 human infections with H5N1 influenza type A were identified in Hong Kong and six of the patients died. There were concomitant outbreaks of H5N1 infections in poultry. The gene segments of the human H5N1 viruses were derived from avian influenza A viruses and not from circulating human influenza A viruses, in 1999 two cases of human infections caused by avian H9N2 virus were also identified in Hong Kong. These events established that avian influenza viruses can infect humans without passage through an intermediate host and without acquiring gene segments from human influenza viruses. The likely origin of the H5N1 viruses has been deduced from molecular analysis of these and other viruses isolated from the region. The gene sequences of the H5N1 viruses were analysed in order to identify the molecular basis for the ability of these avian viruses to infect humans. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We present a stochastic; individual-based model of the reproductive cycle of the mite Varroa jacobsoni, a parasite of honeybees. The model has the interesting property in that its population level behaviour is approximated extremely accurately by the exponential logistic equation or Ricker map. We demonstrated how this approximation is obtained mathematically and how the parameters of the exponential logistic equation can be written in terms of the parameters of the individual-based model. Our procedure demonstrates, in at least one case, how study of animal ecology at an individual level san be used to derive global models which predict population change over time.},

   Pages = {276-279},
   Abstract = {There are global threats to biodiversity with current extinction rates well above background levels(1). Although less well publicized, numerous human languages have also become extinct, and others are threatened with extinction(2,3). However, estimates of the number of threatened languages vary considerably owing to the wide range of criteria used. For example, languages have been classified as threatened if the number of speakers is less than 100, 500, 1,000, 10,000, 20,000 or 100,000 (ref. 3). Here I show, by applying internationally agreed criteria for classifying species extinction risk(4), that languages are more threatened than birds or mammals. Rare languages are more likely to show evidence of decline than commoner ones. Areas with high language diversity also have high bird and mammal diversity and all three show similar relationships to area, latitude, area of forest and, for languages and birds, maximum altitude. The time of human settlement has little effect on current language diversity. Although similar factors explain the diversity of languages and biodiversity, the factors explaining extinction risk for birds and mammals ( high altitude, high human densities and insularity) do not explain the numbers of endangered languages.},

   Abstract = {Influenza viruses (A/Moscow/1019/65, A/England/344/68, PR/8-A/Hong kong/68) were specifically adsorbed from crude egg grown suspensions by their homologous disulphide-linked immunosorbents prepared from the γ-globulin of rabbits immunized with influenza virus from calf-kidney tissue cultures.

In batch experiments 20 mg of the appropriate ‘non-avid’ immunosorbents (from 4–7 ml of serum taken shortly after one dose of antigen) adsorbed approximately 6 × 109, 3 × 109 and 3 × 1010 egg-bit infective dose50 (approximately 1 × 1012, 1·3 × 1012 and 1·9 × 1012 total particles as indicated by haemagglutination assays) of A/Moscow/1019/65, A/England/344/68 and PR/8-A/Hong Kong/68 respectively; and about 50 per cent of infective virus was eluted with alkaline buffers of pH 11·3, 12·0 and 12·5 respectively. After filtration to remove a trace of immunosorbent the eluted virus suspensions contained 40–91,000 HA/mg protein. ‘Avid’ immunosorbents (prepared from serum taken later after booster injections) had greater capacities (approximately 2–4 times) for infective virus than ‘non-avid’ immunosorbents but only 3–18 per cent of virus could be eluted from them. Both ‘non-avid’ and ‘avid’ immunosorbents adsorbed heterologous viruses of the same or different serotypes to those used to prepare the immunosorbents provided there was some similarity in either the haemagglutinin or neuraminidase antigens. However, their capacities for heterologous viruses were reduced in comparison to those for homologous viruses.

Using a column containing a mixture of immunosorbent (100 mg) and Sephadex G-15 approximately 3·5 × 1012 total particles were adsorbed and 50 per cent eluted at each cycle at 5°C. Prior diafiltration of the crude virus suspensions was necessary to prevent column blockage but then the column could be recycled 10 times. The eluted virus suspension had 100,000 HA/mg protein and contained little or no egg or rabbit protein as judged by hypersensitivity reactions in suitably sensitised guinea-pigs.},

   Journal = {British Journal of Experimental Pathology},
   Volume = {60},
   Number = {3},
   Pages = {300-308},
   Abstract = {Intranasal infection of ferrets with a virulent Clone (7a) of the recombinant influenza virus A/PR/8/34—A/England/939/69 (H3N2) produced a fever approximately 24 h in duration beginning about 29 h after infection. The origin of this fever has been investigated as an indication of what might happen in influenza in man. The systemic production of fever by virus interaction with phagocytes in the reticuloendothelial system appeared unlikely because insufficient virus escaped into the bloodstream. Ten half-hourly i.v. injections of 108 50\%0 Egg-Bit Infectious Doses (EBID50) of virus were needed to produce a fever of short duration (3-8 h). Yet, after the intranasal infection, which results in the 24 h fever, the total virus content in the nasal mucosa was less than 108 EBID50 before the onset of fever and only reached 108.5 EBID50 for 4 h during fever. Also, just before or during the fever produced by intranasal infection, influenza virus antigens could not be detected by fluorescent antibody in the spleens of the animals but were detected in animals receiving a single bloodstream injection of 108 EBID50 of virus. Fever is more likely to result from release of leucocyte pyrogen by virus-phagocyte interaction in the upper respiratory tract. A pyrogen active in ferrets with the characteristics of leucocyte (endogenous) pyrogen was produced by incubating influenza virus with ferret peripheral phagocytes in vitro. A pyrogen with similar properties was released by incubation of nasal inflammatory cells collected from infected febrile ferrets and many of the cells were shown by fluorescent antibody to have interacted with influenza virus.},

   Abstract = {Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses are now widespread in poultry in Asia and have recently
spread to some African and European countries. Interspecies transmission of these viruses to humans poses
a major threat to public health. To better understand the basis of pathogenesis of H5N1 viruses, we have
investigated the role of proinflammatory cytokines in transgenic mice deficient in interleukin-6 (IL-6), macrophage
inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1 ), IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), or tumor necrosis factor receptor 1
(TNFR1) by the use of two avian influenza A viruses isolated from humans, A/Hong Kong/483/97 (HK/483) and
A/Hong Kong/486/97 (HK/486), which exhibit high and low lethality in mice, respectively. The course of disease
and the extent of virus replication and spread in IL-6- and MIP-1 -deficient mice were not different from those
observed in wild-type mice during acute infection with 1,000 50% mouse infective doses of either H5N1 virus.
However, with HK/486 virus, IL-1R-deficient mice exhibited heightened morbidity and mortality due to
infection, whereas no such differences were observed with the more virulent HK/483 virus. Furthermore,
TNFR1-deficient mice exhibited significantly reduced morbidity following challenge with either H5N1 virus but
no difference in viral replication and spread or ultimate disease outcome compared with wild-type mice. These
results suggest that TNF-  may contribute to morbidity during H5N1 influenza virus infection, while IL-1 may
be important for effective virus clearance in nonlethal H5N1 disease.},

   Abstract = {A Canadian plan for pandemic influenza was completed by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization in 1988. Its development took several years and involved consultation with provincial public health and laboratory authorities, the licensing body, manufacturers of influenza vaccine and antiviral agents, and representatives in the USA and UK. Key decisions in creating the pandemic plan include: (1) aiming for federal-provincial consensus on use of vaccine and antiviral drugs, (2) a selective vaccination approach (high-risk persons plus essential workers), (3) bulk purchasing and distribution of vaccine through the public sector, (4) leaving antiviral drugs on the open market, (5) careful planning of the communications strategy, and (6) increasing inter-pandemic use of flu vaccine in target groups. The plan addresses recognition of a pandemic; activation of a Pandemic Influenza Committee whose membership and responsibilities are spelled out; the federal-provincial decision making process; influenza vaccine considerations; amantadine and other antiviral agents: estimates of target group size, vaccine uptake, manufacturing capabilities and time frames; and communication considerations. Since 1988, influenza vaccine use has increased considerably in Canada and experience has been gained with amantadine. Manufacturing capability within Canada for influenza vaccine has also been enhanced. It is now time to update the plan, especially the targets, and to make sure that everyone involved remains aware of the assigned roles.},

The febrile response is accompanied by activation of multiple endogenous antipyretic systems that serve to suppress its magnitude or duration. These include neuroactive substances of neural and humoral origin, some of which (e.g., glucocorticoids, melanocortins, and IL-IO) have broad-ranging anti-inflammatory actions. Glucocorticoids, vasopressin, and melanocortins appear to exert their antipyretic effects by acting on receptors within the brain, but beyond this the mechanisms involved are unknown. It is hypothesized, but not proven, that endogenous antipyretic systems protect the host against the destructive consequences of unchecked fever. Importantly, pharmacological blockade of the actions of endogenous antipyretic systems increases fevers of even low to moderate intensity. Therefore, in addition to protecting against catastrophic consequences of high fever, endogenous antipyretic systems seem to play a fundamental physiological role in determining the normal course of fever. Elucidating the neural and biochemical mechanisms involved in suppression of fever by physiological antipyretic systems will yield a rich benefit, both by advancing the basic understanding of host defense strategies, and by permitting the design of novel antipyretic and antiinflammatory strategies for therapeutic intervention in human disease.},

RNA from a victim of the 1918 pandemic was isolated from a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, lung tissue sample. Nine fragments of viral RNA were sequenced from the coding regions of hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, nucleoprotein, matrix protein 1, and matrix protein 2. The sequences are consistent with a novel H1N1 influenza A virus that belongs to the subgroup of strains that infect humans and swine, not the avian subgroup.},

Many questions about its origins, its unusual epiclemiologic features, and the basis of its pathogenicity remain unanswered. The public health implications of the pandemic therefore remain in doubt even as we now grapple with the feared emergence of a pandemic caused by H5N1 or other virus. However, new information about the 1918 virus is emerging, for example, sequencing of the entire genome from archival autopsy tissues. But, the viral genome alone is unlikely to provide answers to some critical questions.

I review 13 possible examples of this phenomenon all I could find in the literature—and find that each either lacks convincing data or is not a true metapopulation. Most of the examples rely on evidence of local extinction and recolonization, only a few using direct experimental methods; I discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these methods, as well as alternatives. I also consider the ways these systems deviate from having pure metapopulation structures, and conclude that most large-scale spatial population structures will not fit cleanly into a metapopulation vs. within-population dichotomy, but rather combine features of both. This will necessitate use of powerful and focused methodology (in particular, experimentation) to directly describe movement rates and patterns, rather than use of crude observational data (e.g. extinctions) to make inferences about movement.},

The main problem is that a finite population is never really Å0ä7Å0Ü6Å0Ç9at equilibriumÅ0ä7Å0Ü6Å0É0 in that it represents just onerealization of an infinite assemblage of possible allelic distributions. A recent paper of Rousset and Billiard (manu-script) provides coefficients which, if used in inclusive fitness models under conditions of weak selection, give us ameasure of average allele frequency change where the average is taken over all such realizations. Their coefficientsare expressed in terms of identity in state, and an alternative formulation (Taylor and Day, manuscript) in terms ofcoefficients of consanguinity permits the calculation of relatedness in simple cases from pedigree analysis. Here weimplement these calculations in a finite asexual haploid population with either a deme structure or a one-dimensionalstepping-stone structure and verify our!   results with numerical simulations in small populations. Our simulations al-low us to investigate the dependence of relatedness on allele frequency, and our results here agree qualitatively withthose obtained by Rousset and Billiard. Finally, we examine a model of altruism in a deme-structured population toverify numerically that our relatedness coefficients provide a correct measure of allele frequency change.},

We study an elaboration of this game, which allows the players to exchange x-offers back and forth in a negotiation phase until they converge to a final pair of contributions, (x) over cap (1) and (x) over cap (2). A significant feature of such negotiation games, hitherto unrecognized, is the existence of a set of neutrally stable equilibrium points in negotiation phase space. To explore the long-term evolutionary outcome of such games, we simulate populations containing various mixtures of negotiation strategies and, contrary to previous results, we often find convergence to a contribution that is more cooperative than the Nash equilibrium. Mathematical analysis suggests why this might be happening, !  and provides a novel and robust explanation for cooperation, that negotiation can facilitate the evolution of cooperative behaviour.},

   Abstract = {Kin selection arguments, based on Hamilton's (1964) concept of inclusive fitness, provide a powerful heuristic and can therefore give us valuable insights into the different pathways through which natural selection acts. But their formulation can be quite tricky, requiring as they do, a close accounting of all the fitness effects of a particular item of behaviour. Here we propose a ''direct fitness'' formulation of inclusive fitness which often has a more straightforward derivation. Our method finds ESS trait values by the standard optimization techniques of simple differentiation plus two additional steps. First, slopes of group phenotype on individual genotype arise naturally during differentiation, and these slopes are replaced by coefficients of relatedness. Second, when behaviours influence different classes such as age, sex of recipient, or other life history components of fitness, the fitness effects on each component are weighted by reproductive value. We illustrate this technique first in a homogeneous population, with examples of group competition and partial dispersal behaviour, and then in a class-structured population, with examples of sex allocation and altruism between age classes.

   Volume = {6},
   Pages = {783-790},
   Abstract = {Over the past few years, prompted by pandemic preparedness initiatives, the debate over the modes of transmission of influenza has been rekindled and several reviews have appeared. Arguments supporting an important role for aerosol transmission that were reviewed included prolonged survival of the virus in aerosol suspensions, demonstration of the low infectious dose required for aerosol transmission in human volunteers, and clinical and epidemiological observations were disentanglements of large droplets and aerosol transmission was possible. Since these reviews were published, several new studies have been done and generated new data. These include direct demonstration of the presence of influenza viruses in aerosolized droplets from the tidal breathing of infected persons and in the air of an emergency department; the establishment of the guinea pig model for influenza transmission, where it was shown that aerosol transmission is important and probably modulated by temperature and humidity; the demonstration of some genetic determinants of airborne transmission of influenza viruses as assessed using the ferret model; and mathematical modelling studies that strongly support the aerosol route.

Another important threshold parameter is the reproduction number R which is the spectral radius of a related positive matrix. As it is well-known, the spectral bound and R − 1 have the same sign provided that the matrices have a particular form. The relation between spectral bound and reproduction number ex- tends to models with infinite dimensional state space and then holds between the spectral bound of a resolvent-positive closed linear operator and the spectral radius of a positive bounded linear operator. We also extend an analogous relation between the spectral radii of two positive linear operators which is relevant for discrete-time models. We illustrate the general theory by applying it to an epidemic model with distributed susceptibility, population models with age structure, and, using evolution semigroups, to time heterogeneous population models.},

   Pages = {179-186},
   Abstract = {Context Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Statistical methods used to estimate deaths in the United States attributable to influenza have not accounted for RSV circulation.
Objective To develop a statistical model using national mortality and viral surveillance data to estimate annual influenza- and RSV-associated deaths in the United States, by age group, virus, and influenza type and subtype.
Design, Setting, and Population Age-specific Poisson regression models using national viral surveillance data for the 1976-1977 through 1998-1999 seasons were used to estimate influenza-associated deaths. Influenza- and RSV-associated deaths were simultaneously estimated for the 1990-1991 through 1998-1999 seasons.
Main Outcome Measures Attributable deaths for 3 categories: underlying pneumonia and influenza, underlying respiratory and circulatory, and all causes.
Results Annual estimates of influenza-associated deaths increased significantly between the 1976-1977 and 1998-1999 seasons for all 3 death categories (P<.001 for each category). For the 1990-1991 through 1998-1999 seasons, the greatest mean numbers of deaths were associated with influenza A(H3N2) viruses, followed by RSV, influenza B, and influenza A(H1N1). Influenza viruses and RSV, respectively, were associated with annual means (SD) of 8097 (3084) and 2707 (196) underlying pneumonia and influenza deaths, 36155 (11055) and 11321 (668) underlying respiratory and circulatory deaths, and 51203 (15081) and 17358 (1086) all-cause deaths. For underlying respiratory and circulatory deaths, 90% of influenza- and 78% of RSV-associated deaths occurred among persons aged 65 years or older, Influenza was associated with more deaths than RSV in all age groups except for children younger than 1 year. On average, influenza was associated with 3 times as many deaths as RSV.
Conclusions Mortality associated with both influenza and RSV circulation disproportionately affects elderly persons. Influenza deaths have increased substantially in the last 2 decades, in part because of aging of the population, underscoring the need for better prevention measures, including more effective vaccines and vaccination programs for elderly persons.},

   Abstract = {Context Respiratory viral infections are responsible for a large number of hospitalizations in the United States each year. Objective To estimate annual influenza-associated hospitalizations in the United States by hospital discharge category, discharge type, and age group. Design, Setting, and Participants National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) data and World Health Organization Collaborating Laboratories influenza surveillance data were used to estimate annual average numbers of hospitalizations associated with the circulation of influenza viruses from the 1979-1980 through the 2000-2001 seasons in the United States using age-specific Poisson regression models. Main Outcome Measures We estimated influenza-associated hospitalizations for primary and any listed pneumonia and influenza and respiratory and circulatory hospitalizations. Results Annual averages of 94735 (range, 18908-193561) primary and 133 900 (range, 30757-271529) any listed pneumonia and influenza hospitalizations were associated with influenza virus infections. Annual averages of 226 054 (range, 54523-430960) primary and 294128 (range, 86494-544909) any listed respiratory and circulatory hospitalizations were associated with influenza virus infections. Persons 85 years or older had the highest rates of influenza-associated primary respiratory and circulatory hospitalizations (1194.9 per 100000 persons). Children younger than 5 years (107.9 primary respiratory and circulatory hospitalizations per 100000 persons) had rates similar to persons aged 50 through 64 years. Estimated rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations were highest during seasons in which A(H3N2) viruses predominated, followed by B and A(H1N1) seasons. After adjusting for the length of each influenza season, influenza-associated primary pneumonia and influenza hospitalizations increased over time among the elderly. There were no significant increases in influenza-associated primary respiratory and circulatory hospitalizations after adjusting for the length of the influenza season. Conclusions Significant numbers of influenza- associated hospitalizations in the United States occur among the elderly, and the numbers of these hospitalizations have increased substantially over the last 2 decades due in part to the aging of the population. Children younger than 5 years had rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations similar to those among individuals aged 50 through 64 years. These findings highlight the need for improved influenza prevention efforts for both young and older US residents.},

   Abstract = {A long-lived  two-armed spiral has been generated in an $N$-body computer simulation of a galaxy with a static bulge and halo and an active disk composed of 60000 particles.  The spiral lasts for about three pattern revolutions without severe distortion and persists for at least two more revolutions with distortions and bifurcations resulting from an increasingly clumpy interstellar medium.  This suggests that two-armed grand design spirals in nonbarred, noninteracting galaxies can be long-lived if star formation and other heat sources not present in the simulation maintain a steady interstellar medium.  The key factors contributing to the generation of this pattern are (1)~a $Q$-barrier in the inner region, (2)~a mass distribution and rotation curve that allows swing amplification of $m=2$ waves with an inner Lindblad resonance inside the $Q$-barrier, (3)~a star-cooling routine that keep the stellar velocity dispersion constant with adiabatic variations allowed, and (4)~a substantial amount of cold, dissipating gas in the disk.  The stellar pattern extends from the $Q$-barrier to the outer Lindblad resonance, and the gaseous pattern extends from the region of the inner Lindblad resonance to the outer Lindblad resonance.},

   Abstract = {Management of pediatric fever is controversial. Although many nursing texts advocate aggressive fever management, research provides evidence that fever is a normal physiologic process with beneficial effects. We sought to describe emergency nurses' pediatric fever management practices, their rationales for practice, and their practice consistency. A researcher-developed tool was mailed to a systematic random sample of approximately 5\% of ENA members. Surveys were mailed to 1136 nurses nationally; 731 surveys were returned (64\% response rate). Temperature at which nurses initiate fever interventions varied from 37.8 degrees C (100 degrees F) to 40.6 degrees C (105 degrees F). Most frequently identified rationales for intervention were prevention of fever increase (83.3\%), fever reduction (76.9\%), comfort (74.7\%), and seizure prevention (65.3\%). Most nurses (79.8\%) employ tepid sponging to reduce fever; 31\% sponge routinely. Nurses reported sponging for temperatures higher than 38.9 degrees C (102 degrees F) to 40.6 degrees C (105 degrees F). Rationales for sponging included seizure prevention (58\%), rapid cooling (56.8\%), and treatment of fevers unresponsive to antipyretics (45.6\%). Factors influencing rationales for practice included departmental standards of care (67.2\%), physician practices (65.8\%), and common sense (64.2\%). The results of this nationwide survey demonstrate that fever management practices vary. ED nurses are practicing in a manner consistent with that advocated in many nursing texts but not necessarily the research literature. We believe that clinical trials of commonly used fever treatments are indicated. Standards of care could then be revised to reflect the research literature.},

   Abstract = {Black bears hibernate for 5 to 7 months a year and, during this time, do not eat, drink, urinate, or defecate. We measured metabolic rate and body temperature in hibernating black bears and found that they suppress metabolism to 25\% of basal rates while regulating body temperature from 30° to 36°C, in multiday cycles. Heart rates were reduced from 55 to as few as 9 beats per minute, with profound sinus arrhythmia. After returning to normal body temperature and emerging from dens, bears maintained a reduced metabolic rate for up to 3 weeks. The pronounced reduction and delayed recovery of metabolic rate in hibernating bears suggest that the majority of metabolic suppression during hibernation is independent of lowered body temperature.},

   Pages = {444-458},
   Abstract = {Virus titres in the nasal washes of ferrets infected with recombinant
influenza virus A/PR/8/34-A/England/939/69 (H3N2) clones 7a (virulent) and 64d
(attenuated) showed four phases; a phase of logarithmic increase, a plateau, a period
of rapid decline and a small rise on the 4th day. The virulent clone remained in the
phase of logarithmic increase longer, reached plateau levels 10-fold higher and
took longer to reduce to low levels than the attenuated clone. Pyrexia (more severe
and prolonged for clone 7a) and inflammatory response (similar for both clones,
consisting of 9000 polymorphonuclear (PMN) and 10o mononuclear (MN) phagocytes)
occurred at about the same time (25-29 h after inoculation) for both clones.
However, the onset of the period of rapid decline of clone 64d in the nasal washes
occurred 4-8 h before that for 7a in 11 of 16 ferrets. Furthermore, significant correlations
were found between increases in temperature and numbers of inflammatory
cells and subsequent reductions in virus titres in nasal washes; and the delay between
the responses and subsequent correlated reductions of virus was less for clone 64d
than for clone 7a. Thus, a link between temperature rise and inflammatory response
and subsequent reduction of virus titre was detected and, whatever the mechanisms
of this link, it acted differentially on the clones of differing virulence. However,
the period of logarithmic increase of clone 64d ended before pyrexia and inflammation
were detected and, in the plateau stage at the onset of the host responses, there
were no significant correlations between them and virus levels measured at the
same time or shortly afterwards. Pyrexia and inflammation also seemed to be
connected with decline of virus recoveries for infections with virus strains
A/PR/8/34 (HoNi) and A/New Jersey/18/76 (Hsw5N1).
The significance of the relations between pyrexia and cell response and decline
of virus titres in nasal washings is discussed.},

   Abstract = {The flight of 500 000-800 000 Rwandan refugees into the North Kivu region of Zaire in July, 1994, overwhelmed the world's response capacity. During the first month after the influx, almost 50 000 refugees died, an average crude mortality rate of 20-35 per 10 000 per day. This death rate was associated with explosive epidemics of diarrhoeal disease caused by Vibrio cholerae 01 and Shigella dysenteriae type 1. 3-4 weeks after the influx of refugees, acute malnutrition rates among children under 5 years old ranged between 18 and 23%. Children with a recent history of dysentery and those in households headed by women were at higher risk of malnutrition. A well-coordinated relief programme, based on rapidly acquired health data and effective interventions, was associated with a steep decline in death rates to 5 to 8 per 10 000 per day by the second month of the crisis. The prevention of high mortality due to diarrhoeal disease epidemics in displaced populations relies primarily on the prompt provision of adequate quantities of disinfected water, basic sanitation, community outreach, and effective case management of ill patients. In the emergency phase, effective, low-technology measures include bucket chlorination at untreated water sources, designated defaecation areas, active case-finding through community outreach, and oral rehydration. Relief agencies must place increased emphasis on training personnel in relevant skills to address major public health emergencies caused by population displacement.},

It is shown that any packet of such waves propagates radially (and toward increasingly short wavelengths) with a group velocity that is sufficient to obliterate it within a few galactic revolutions.
This does not necessarily mean that the density-wave hypothesis is wrong.  But it does imply that any existing spiral waves in the disk of a galaxy must somehow be replenished if their pattern as a whole is to persist.  Three conceivable sources of such replenishment are also discussed in this paper.},

   Abstract = {A practical step-by-step guide to wavelet analysis is given, with examples taken from time series of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The guide includes a comparison to the windowed Fourier transform, the choice of an appropriate wavelet basis function, edge effects due to finite-length time series, and the relationship between wavelet scale and Fourier frequency. New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. It is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum. Empirical formulas are given for the effect of smoothing on significance levels and confidence intervals. Extensions to wavelet analysis such as filtering, the power Hovmoller, cross-wavelet spectra, and coherence are described.
The statistical significance tests are used to give a quantitative measure of changes in ENSO variance on interdecadal timescales. Using new datasets that extend back to 1871, the Nino3 sea surface temperature and the Southern Oscillation index show significantly higher power during 1880-1920 and 1960-90, and lower power during 1920-60, as well as a possible 15-yr modulation of variance. The power Hovmoller of sea level pressure shows significant variations in 2-8-yr wavelet power in both longitude and time.},

Studies of coherence patterns recorded directly from human cortex are reviewed along with the presentation of original human clinical data, which reveal reliable and characteristic patterns of coherence. A data- driven technique for discriminating between reliable and unreliable coherence and phase values is described and used to reveal the relationship between coherence and cortical anatomy, such as in the region of the central sulcus, where low phase coherence declines and high phase-shifted coherence increases. Analysis of coherence magnitude and phase makes it possible to determine which signals likely arise from the cortical surface, and which arise from the depths of a sulcus. Alterations in coherence patterns caused by tumors or epilepsy are described and may be used to identify normal and pathological functional relationships between distant cortical areas. Some electrophysiologic/pathologic correlations indicate at least two types of epileptic abnormality, implying a sequence in breakdown of epileptic tissue. The relationship between coherence patterns and behavior and cognition is introduced and compared to similar studies of single-unit binding in animals.},

We show that a formula of this type is valid so long as the angular speed of the test object changes sufficiently rapidly.  If the angular speed is slowly changing two new effects appear: a reversible dynamical feedback which can stabilize or destabilize the rotation speed, and permanent capture of near-resonant stars into librating orbits.  We discuss orbital decay of satellites in the light of these results.},

We also show that dropping any of these features results in a drastically different behaviour, leading either to the extinction of the disease, to the proliferation of the viral strains or to their divergence.},

The authors analyze Census and Vital Statistics data for Canada and the provinces for 1881 and from 1926-1989. The result indicate that the Canadian pattern closely approximates the European model, but only since the early part of this century. Thus a radical change took place between the late 1880s and the early part of this century.

   Abstract = {BACKGROUND Information on the clinical features of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) will be of value to physicians caring for patients suspected of having this disorder. METHODS We abstracted data on the clinical presentation and course of disease in 10 epidemiologically linked Chinese patients (5 men and 5 women 38 to 72 years old) in whom SARS was diagnosed between February 22, 2003, and March 22, 2003, at our hospitals in Hong Kong, China. RESULTS Exposure between the source patient and subsequent patients ranged from minimal to that between patient and health care provider. The incubation period ranged from 2 to 11 days. All patients presented with fever (temperature, >38 degreesC for over 24 hours), and most presented with rigor, dry cough, dyspnea, malaise, headache, and hypoxemia. Physical examination of the chest revealed crackles and percussion dullness. Lymphopenia was observed in nine patients, and most patients had mildly elevated aminotransferase levels but normal serum creatinine levels. Serial chest radiographs showed progressive air-space disease. Two patients died of progressive respiratory failure; histologic analysis of their lungs showed diffuse alveolar damage. There was no evidence of infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, or Legionella pneumophila. All patients received corticosteroid and ribavirin therapy a mean (+/-SD) of 9.6+/-5.42 days after the onset of symptoms, and eight were treated earlier with a combination of beta-lactams and macrolide for 4+/-1.9 days, with no clinical or radiologic efficacy. CONCLUSIONS SARS appears to be infectious in origin. Fever followed by rapidly progressive respiratory compromise is the key complex of signs and symptoms from which the syndrome derives its name. The microbiologic origins of SARS remain unclear. .},

   Abstract = {In the face of an influenza pandemic, accurate estimates of epidemiologic parameters are required to help guide decision-making. We sought to estimate epidemiologic parameters for pandemic H1N1 influenza using data from initial reports of laboratory-confirmed cases. We obtained data on laboratory-confirmed cases of pandemic H1N1 influenza reported in the province of Ontario, Canada, with dates of symptom onset between Apr. 13 and June 20, 2009. Incubation periods and duration of symptoms were estimated and fit to parametric distributions. We used competing-risk models to estimate risk of 
hospital admission and case-fatality rates. We used a Markov Chain Monte Carlo model to simulate disease  
transmission. The median incubation period was 4 days and the duration of symptoms was 7 days. Recovery was faster among patients less than 18 years old than among older patients (hazard ratio 1.23, 95\% confidence interval 1.06--1.44). The risk of hospital admission was 4.5\% (95\% CI 3.8\%--5.2\%) and the case-fatality rate was 0.3\% (95\% CI 0.1\%--0.5\%). The risk of hospital admission was highest among patients less than 1 year old and those 65 years or older. Adults more than 50 years old comprised 7\% of cases but accounted for 7 of 10 initial deaths (odds ratio 28.6, 95\% confidence interval 7.3--111.2). From the simulation models, we estimated the following values (and 95\% credible intervals): a mean basic reproductive number (R0, the number of new cases created by a single primary case in a susceptible population) of 1.31 (1.25--1.38), a mean latent period of 2.62 (2.28--3.12) days and a mean duration of infectiousness of 3.38 (2.06--4.69) days. From these values we estimated a serial interval (the average time from onset of infectiousness in a case to the onset of infectiousness in a person infected by that case) of 4--5 days. The low estimates for R0 indicate that effective mitigation strategies may reduce the final epidemic impact of pandemic H1N1 influenza. },

In this paper, we have constructed a few model systems describing real ecological situations and analysed them using a methodology designed for the purpose. Simulation experiments suggest that both these factors should be given equal weightage in working out strategies for any conservation effort. We conclude that the complex ecosystems are safe places for species belonging to the higher life forms, especially, generalist predators. On the contrary, simple (small) ecosystems cannot harbour these species for long. Another useful observation is that the vertebrate predators should be preferred to their invertebrate counterparts while aiming at conserving endangered prey species. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) transfer function models were used to perform a time-series analysis. These models were compared with simple cross correlations by using Pearson's product moment correlation. The results showed statistically significant correlations between the presence of influenza virus and admissions of the elderly for pneumonia (in all 5 years under study) and chronic lung disease (in 4 of the 5 years under study). The relation between circulation of influenza virus and admissions for congestive heart failure was inconsistent. The simple cross correlation tended to overestimate the association between the presence of circulating influenza strains and hospital admissions. Measures of the impact of influenza should include chronic lung disease as an outcome. Further studies, with greater covariate control, are required to delineate more precisely the relation between influenza and hospital morbidity in the elderly. This study demonstrates the power and utility of using time-series methods in the epidemiologic study of communicable diseases.},

   Journal = {Tropical Medicine and International Health},
   Volume = {6},
   Number = {9},
   Pages = {677-687},
   Abstract = {Roll back malaria (RBM) aims at halving the current burden of the disease by the year 2010. The focus is on sub-Saharan Africa, and it is proposed to implement efficacious and cost- effective control strategies. But the evidence base of such information is scarce, and a notable missing element is the discussion of the potential of environmental management. We reviewed the literature and identified multiple malaria control programmes that incorporated environmental management as the central feature. Prominent among them are programmes launched in 1929 and implemented for two decades at copper mining communities in Zambia. The full package of control measures consisted of vegetation clearance, modification of river boundaries, draining swamps, oil application to open water bodies and house screening. Part of the population also was given quinine and was sleeping under mosquito nets. Monthly malaria incidence rates and vector densities were used for surveillance and adaptive tuning of the environmental management strategies to achieve a high level of performance. Within 3-5 years, malaria-related mortality, morbidity and incidence rates were reduced by 70-95%. Over the entire 20 years of implementation, the programme had averted an estimated 4173 deaths and 161205 malaria attacks. The estimated costs per death and malaria attack averted were US$ 858 and US$ 22.20, respectively. Over the initial 3-5 years start-up period, analogous to the short-duration of cost-effectiveness analyses of current studies, we estimated that the costs per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted were US$ 524-591. However, the strategy has a track record of becoming cost-effective in the longer term, as maintenance costs were much lower: US$ 22- 92 per DALY averted. In view of fewer adverse ecological effects, increased sustainability and better uses of local resources and knowledge, environmental management - integrated with pharmacological, insecticidal and bednet interventions - could substantially increase the chances of rolling back malaria.},

   Abstract = {Background In South Africa, as part of an effort to eliminate indigenous measles by 2002, vaccination campaigns were conducted in 1996-1997 targeting all children aged 9 months to 14 years; coverage was estimated at 85\%. The impact of the campaigns on measles disease burden was evaluated in 1999.
Methods We analysed routine measles surveillance data and undertook a retrospective review of hospital registers in two of South Africa's nine provinces.
Results In Mpumalanga in the pre-campaign years (1992-1996), 4498 measles cases and 6 deaths were reported; 182 cases and no deaths were reported in 1997-1998. Hospital registers showed 1647 measles hospitalizations and 11 deaths in the pre-campaign period, and 60 hospitalizations and no deaths after the campaign (1997-April 1999). In Western Cape in pre-campaign years (1992-1997), 5164 measles cases and 19 deaths were reported; 132 cases and no deaths were reported in 1998. Hospital registers showed 736 measles hospitalizations and 23 deaths in the pre-campaign period, and 29 measles hospitalizations and no deaths post-campaign (1998-July 1999).
Conclusions Study findings indicate that reported measles cases, measles-related hospitalizations and deaths were considerably reduced in both provinces after the campaign compared with the pre-campaign period. Longer observation is needed to evaluate the long-term impact of the campaigns.},

   Abstract = {Until now, mortality and spreading mechanisms of influenza pandemics have been studied only for the 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemics; none have concerned the 19th century. Herein, we examined the 1889 ''Russian'' pandemic. Clinical attack rates were retrieved for 408 geographic entities in 14 European countries and in the United States. Case fatality ratios were estimated from data-sets in the French, British and German armies, and morbidity and mortality records of Swiss cities. Weekly all-cause mortality was analyzed in 96 European and American cities. The pandemic spread rapidly, taking only 4 months to circumnavigate the planet, peaking in the United States 70 days after the original peak in St. Petersburg. The median and interquartile range of clinical attack rates was 60\% (45-70\%). The case fatality ratios ranged from 0.1\% to 0.28\%, which is comparable to those of 1957 and 1968, and 10-fold lower than in 1918. The median basic reproduction number (R-0) was 2.1, which is comparable to the values found for the other pandemics, despite the different viruses and contact networks. R-0 values varied widely from one city to another, and only a small minority of those values was within the range in which modelers' mitigation scenarios predicted effectiveness. The 1889 and 1918 R-0 correlated for the subset of cities for which both values were available. Social and geographic factors probably shape the local R-0, and they could be identified to design optimal mitigation scenarios tailored to each city.},

and virulence. Spread of diseases in human populations can, however, exhibit large scale patterns, underlining the need forspatially explicit approaches to pathogen evolution. Here, we show, in a spatial model where all pathogen traits are allowed to evolve independently, that evolutionary trajectories follow a single relationship between transmission and clearance. This trade off relation is an emergent system property, as opposed to being a property of pathogen physiology, and maximizes outbreak
frequency instead of the number of secondary infections. We conclude that spatial pattern formation in contact networks can act to link infectiousness and clearance during pathogen evolution in the absence of any physiological trade-off. Selection for outbreak frequency offers an explanation for the evolution of pathogens that cause mild but frequent infections.},

   Abstract = {Biological communities are affected by perturbations that Frequently occur in a more-or-less periodic fashion. In this communication we use the circle map to summarize the dynamics of one such community - the periodically forced Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system. As might be expected, we show that the latter system generates a classic devil's staircase and Arnold tongues, similar to that found from a qualitative analysis of the circle map. The circle map has other subtle features that make it useful for explaining the two qualitatively distinct forms of chaos recently noted in numerical studies of the forced Lotka-Volterra system. In the regions of overlapping tongues, coexisting attractors may be found in the Lotka- Volterra system, including at least one example of three alternative attractors, the separatrices of which are fractal and, in one specific case, Wada. The analysis is extended to a periodically forced tritrophic foodweb model that is chaotic, interestingly, mode-locking Arnold tongue structures are observed in the model's phase dynamics even though the foodweb equations are chaotic.

   Abstract = {In both strictly theoretical and more applied contexts it has been historically assumed that metapopulations exist within a featureless, uninhabitable matrix and that dynamics within the matrix are unimportant. In this article, we explore the range of theoretical consequences that result from relaxing this assumption. We show, with a variety of modeling techniques, that matrix quality can be extremely important in determining metapopulation dynamics. A higher-quality matrix generally buffers against extinction. However, in some situations, an increase in matrix quality can generate chaotic subpopulation dynamics, where stability had been the rule in a lower-quality matrix. Furthermore, subpopulations acting as source populations in a low-quality matrix may develop metapopulation dynamics as the quality of the matrix increases. By forcing metapopulation dynamics on a formerly heterogeneous (but stable within subpopulations) population, the probability of simultaneous extinction of all subpopulations actually increases. Thus, it cannot be automatically assumed that increasing matrix quality will lower the probability of global extinction of a population.},

A key insight is that the efficacy of the T-cell response is best analyzed in terms of T-cell receptor (TCR) avidity and the distribution of this avidity across the TCR repertoire (the 'avidity spectrum'). Modification of this avidity spectrum by a wide range of tuning and tolerance mechanisms allows the system to adapt cross-reactivity and specificity to the challenge at hand while avoiding inappropriate responses against non-pathogenic cells and tissues. Theoretical models relate molecular kinetic parameters and cellular properties to systemic level statistics such as avidity spectra. Such bridge equations are crucial for rational clinical manipulation of T cells at the molecular level.},

The study of the role of bifidobacteria in the colon is complicated by the fact that they are part of a complex ecosystem also interacting with the human host and by the fact that their in vivo study encounters many ethical constraints. Several tools have been developed at TNO with which the role of bifidobacteria can be studied. These include (i) an efficient transformation protocol for the introduction of foreign DNA into Bifidobacterium strains and (ii) in vitro models of the stomach/small intestine (TIM-1) and large intestine (TIM-2), creating an environment closely resembling that of the in vivo situation. With these tools, biomarkers from bifidobacteria quantifying their positive effect on gut health can be identified.},

An analysis of the local centre manifold yields a simple criterion for the existence and stability of super- and sub-threshold endemic equilibria for R-0 near one. This criterion, together with the definition of R-0, is illustrated by treatment, multigroup, staged progression, multistrain and vector-host models and can be applied to more complex models.

   Journal = {Journal of Virology},
   Volume = {83},
   Number = {7},
   Pages = {2851-2861},
   Abstract = {Although highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses have yet to acquire the ability to transmit efficiently among humans, the increasing genetic diversity among these viruses and continued outbreaks in avian species underscore the need for more effective measures for the control and prevention of human H5N1 virus infection. Additional small animal models with which therapeutic approaches against virulent influenza viruses can be evaluated are needed. In this study, we used the guinea pig model to evaluate the relative virulence of selected avian and human influenza A viruses. We demonstrate that guinea pigs can be infected with avian and human influenza viruses, resulting in high titers of virus shedding in nasal washes for up to 5 days postinoculation (p.i.) and in lung tissue of inoculated animals. However, other physiologic indicators typically associated with virulent influenza virus strains were absent in this species. We evaluated the ability of intranasal treatment with human alpha interferon (alpha-IFN) to reduce lung and nasal wash titers in guinea pigs challenged with the reconstructed 1918 pandemic H1N1 virus or a contemporary H5N1 virus. IFN treatment initiated 1 day prior to challenge significantly reduced or prevented infection of guinea pigs by both viruses, as measured by virus titer determination and seroconversion. The expression of the antiviral Mx protein in lung tissue correlated with the reduction of virus titers. We propose that the guinea pig may serve as a useful small animal model for testing the efficacy of antiviral compounds and that alpha-IFN treatment may be a useful antiviral strategy against highly virulent strains with pandemic potential.},

   Pages = {1655-1662},
   Abstract = {We expect social networks to change as a result of illness, but social contact data are generally collected from healthy persons. Here we quantified the impact of influenza-like illness on social mixing patterns. We analyzed the contact patterns of persons from England measured when they were symptomatic with influenza-like illness during the 2009 A/H1N1pdm influenza epidemic (20092010) and again 2 weeks later when they had recovered. Illness was associated with a reduction in the number of social contacts, particularly in settings outside the home, reducing the reproduction number to about one-quarter of the value it would otherwise have taken. We also observed a change in the age distribution of contacts. By comparing the expected age distribution of cases resulting from transmission by (a)symptomatic persons with incidence data, we estimated the contribution of both groups to transmission. Using this, we calculated the fraction of transmission resulting from (a)symptomatic persons, assuming equal duration of infectiousness. We estimated that 66 of transmission was attributable to persons with symptomatic disease (95 confidence interval: 0.23, 1.00). This has important implications for control: Treating symptomatic persons with antiviral agents or encouraging home isolation would be expected to have a major impact on transmission, particularly since the reproduction number for this strain was low.},

   Journal = {PLoS Computational Biology},
   Volume = {3},
   Number = {5},
   Pages = {0796-0802},
   Abstract = {Previous modeling studies have identified the vaccination coverage level necessary for preventing influenza epidemics, but have not shown whether this critical coverage can be reached. Here we use computational modeling to determine, for the first time, whether the critical coverage for influenza can be achieved by voluntary vaccination. We construct a novel individual-level model of human cognition and behavior; individuals are characterized by two biological attributes (memory and adaptability) that they use when making vaccination decisions. We couple this model with a population-level model of influenza that includes vaccination dynamics. The coupled models allow individual-level decisions to influence influenza epidemiology and, conversely, influenza epidemiology to influence individual-level decisions. By including the effects of adaptive decision-making within an epidemic model, we can reproduce two essential characteristics of influenza epidemiology: annual variation in epidemic severity and sporadic occurrence of severe epidemics. We suggest that individual-level adaptive decision-making may be an important (previously overlooked) causal factor in driving influenza epidemiology. We find that severe epidemics cannot be prevented unless vaccination programs offer incentives. Frequency of severe epidemics could be reduced if programs provide, as an incentive to be vaccinated, several years of free vaccines to individuals who pay for one year of vaccination. Magnitude of epidemic amelioration will be determined by the number of years of free vaccination, an individuals' adaptability in decision-making, and their memory. This type of incentive program could control epidemics if individuals are very adaptable and have long-term memories. However, incentive-based programs that provide free vaccination for families could increase the frequency of severe epidemics. We conclude that incentive-based vaccination programs are necessary to control influenza, but some may be detrimental. Surprisingly, we find that individuals' memories and flexibility in adaptive decision-making can be extremely important factors in determining the success of influenza vaccination programs. Finally, we discuss the implication of our results for controlling pandemics},

   Journal = {CMAJ},
   Volume = {169},

   Pages = {285-292},
   Abstract = {Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was introduced into Canada by a visitor to Hong Kong who returned to Toronto on Feb. 23, 2003. Transmission to a family member who was later admitted to a community hospital in Toronto led to a large nosocomial outbreak. In this report we summarize the preliminary results of the epidemiological investigation into the transmission of SARS between 128 cases associated with this hospital outbreak.  Methods: We collected epidemiologic data on 128 probable and suspect cases of SARS associated with the hospital outbreak, including those who became infected in hospital and the next generation of illness arising among their contacts. Incubation periods were calculated based on cases with a single known exposure. Transmission chains from the index family to hospital contacts and within the hospital were mapped. Attack rates were calculated for nurses in 3 hospital wards where transmission occurred.  Results: The cases ranged in age from 21 months to 86 years; 60.2% were female. Seventeen deaths were reported (case-fatality rate 13.3%). Of the identified cases, 36.7% were hospital staff. Other cases were household or social contacts of SARS cases (29.6%), hospital patients (14.1%), visitors (14.1%) or other health care workers (5.5%). Of the 128 cases, 120 (93.8%) had documented contact with a SARS case or with a ward where there was a known SARS case. The remaining 8 cases without documented exposure are believed to have had exposure to an unidentified case and remain under investigation. The attack rates among nurses who worked in the emergency department, intensive care unit and coronary care unit ranged from 10.3% to 60.0%. Based on 42 of the 128 cases with a single known contact with a SARS case, the mean incubation period was 5 days (range 2 to 10 days).  Interpretation: Evidence to date suggests that SARS is a severe respiratory illness spread mainly by respiratory droplets. There has been no evidence of further transmission within the hospital after the elapse of 2 full incubation periods (20 days).},

   Abstract = {Community ecology is often perceived as a “mess,” given the seemingly vast number of processes that can underlie the many patterns of interest, and the apparent uniqueness of each study system. However, at the most general level, patterns in the composition and diversity of species—the subject matter of community ecology—are influenced by only four classes of process: selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal. Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal, to drive community dynamics.},

   Abstract = {Objective: To document the duration of protection afforded by Oka/Merck varicella vaccine over a 7-year period. Study design: The subjects were healthy children 1 to 12 years of age originally enrolled in clinical studies to evaluate the primary immune response to varicella vaccine 6 weeks after vaccination. Each was monitored for antibody persistence, breakthrough infection, and household exposure to varicella to produce estimates of vaccine efficacy. Results: The 6-year cumulative varicella antibody persistence rate was 99.5% (95% CI: 98.9%, 100.0%). The annual breakthrough rate through 7 years ranged from 0.2% to 2.3% per year; the estimated cumulative event rate,vas 6.5%. Comparison of the observed average annual breakthrough rate with the age-adjusted expected annual incidence rate of varicella in unvaccinated children corresponded to an estimated vaccine efficacy of 93.8% to 94.6%. Eighty vaccinated children were exposed to varicella in the household, resulting in 8 (10%) cases of infection. When compared with the historical attack rate of 86.8% in unvaccinated susceptible persons exposed to varicella in the household, this yields an estimated vaccine efficacy of 88.5% (95% CI: 80.9%, 96.1%). Varicella cases in vaccinated children generally were mild. Conclusion: The live attenuated varicella vaccine is highly effective in inducing persistent immunity and long-term protection against breakthrough varicella infection.},

   Abstract = {Background. The first pandemic season of A/H3N2 influenza virus (1968/1969) resulted in significant mortality in the United States, but it was the second pandemic season of A/H3N2 influenza virus (1969/1970) that caused the majority of deaths in England. We further explored the global pattern of mortality caused by the pandemic during this period. Methods. We estimated the influenza-related excess mortality in 6 countries (United States, Canada, England and Wales, France, Japan, and Australia) using national vital statistics by age for 1967-1978. Geographical and temporal pandemic patterns in mortality were compared with the genetic drift of the influenza viruses by analyzing hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequences from GenBank. Results. In North America, the majority of influenza-related deaths in 1968/1969 and 1969/1970 occurred during the first pandemic season (United States, 70\%; Canada, 54\%). Conversely, in Europe and Asia, the pattern was reversed: 70\% of deaths occurred during the second pandemic season. The second pandemic season coincided with a drift in the neuraminidase antigen. Conclusion. We found a consistent pattern of mortality being delayed until the second pandemic season of A/H3N2 circulation in Europe and Asia. We hypothesize that this phenomenon may be explained by higher preexisting neuraminidase immunity (from the A/H2N2 era) in Europe and Asia than in North America, combined with a subsequent drift in the neuraminidase antigen during 1969/1970.},

   Abstract = {There are important gaps in our current understanding of the influenza virus behavior. In particular, it remains unclear why some inter-pandemic seasons are associated with unusually high mortality impact, sometimes comparable to that of pandemics. Here we compare the epidemiological patterns of the unusually deadly 1951 influenza epidemic (A/H1N1) in England and Wales and Canada with those of surrounding epidemic and pandemic seasons, in terms of overall mortality impact and transmissibility. Based on the statistical and mathematical analysis of vital statistics and morbidity epidemic curves in these two countries, we show that the 1951 epidemic was associated with both higher mortality impact and higher transmissibility than the 1957 and 1968 pandemics. Surprisingly in Liverpool, considered the ‘epicenter’ of the severe 1951 epidemic, the mortality impact and transmissibility even surpassed the 1918 pandemic.},

   Pages = {448-451},
   Abstract = {According to the social intelligence hypothesis, social context represents an important force driving the selection of animal cognitive abilities such as the capacity to estimate the nature of the social relationships between other individuals(1-4). Despite this importance, the influence of this force has been assessed only in primates and never in other animals showing social interactions(5-7). In this way, avian communication generally takes place in a network of signallers and receivers, which represents an audience altering individual signalling behaviours(8,9). Indeed, vocal amplitude(10) and repertoire(11) are known to be socially regulated and the attitude towards the opposite sex may change depending on the audience(8,12,13). This 'audience effect'(8,14-16) provides support for the reality of social awareness in some bird species. However no evidence has yet been found to suggest that birds are able to estimate the characteristics of the social relationships between group-mates. Here we show that the male of a gregarious songbird species-the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata)-pays attention to the mating status of conspecific pairs, and uses this information to control its behaviour towards its female partner.},

However, TCR triggering led to an upregulation of ~75-fold in PLC-γ1 expression, which correlated with greater TCR responsiveness. Induction of PLC-γ1 was dependent on vitamin D and expression of the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Naive T cells did not express VDR, but VDR expression was induced by TCR signaling via the alternative mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 pathway. Thus, initial TCR signaling via p38 leads to successive induction of VDR and PLC-γ1, which are required for subsequent classical TCR signaling and T cell activation.},

   Journal = {American Naturalist},
   Volume = {160},
   Number = {3},
   Pages = {285-292},
   Abstract = {Males and females are often defined by differences in their energetic investment in gametes. In most sexual species, females produce few large ova, whereas males produce many tiny sperm. This difference in initial parental investment is presumed to exert a fundamental influence on sex differences in mating and parental behavior, resulting in a taxonomic bias toward parental care in females and away from parental care in males. In this article, we reexamine the logic of this argument as well as the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) theory often used to substantiate it. We show that the classic ESS model, which contrasts parental care with offspring desertion, violates the necessary relationship between mean male and female fitness. When the constraint of equal male and female mean fitness is correctly incorporated into the ESS model, its results are congruent with those of evolutionary genetic theory for the evolution of genes with direct and indirect effects. Male parental care evolves whenever half the magnitude of the indirect effect of paternal care on offspring viability exceeds the direct effect of additional mating success gained by desertion. When the converse is true, desertion invades and spreads. In the absence of a genetic correlation between the sexes, the evolution of paternal care is independent of maternal care. Theories based on sex differences in gametic investment make no such specific predictions. We discuss whether inferences about the evolution of sex differences in parental care can hold if the ESS theory on which they are based contains internal contradictions.},

Methods 12 children (mean age 6 years [range 3-10], 11 boys) were referred to a paediatric gastroenterology unit with a history of normal development followed by loss of acquired skills, including language, together with diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Children underwent gastroenterological, neurological, and developmental assessment and review of developmental records. Ileocolonoscopy and biopsy sampling, magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and lumbar puncture were done under sedation. Barium follow- through radiography was done where possible. Biochemical, haematological, and immunological profiles were examined. Findings Onset of behavioural symptoms was associated, by the parents, with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination in eight of the 12 children, with measles infection in one child, and otitis media in another. All 12 children had intestinal abnormalities, ranging from lymphoid nodular hyperplasia to aphthoid ulceration. Histology showed patchy chronic inflammation in the colon in 11 children and reactive ileal lymphoid hyperplasia in seven, but no granulomas. Behavioural disorders included autism (nine), disintegrative psychosis (one), and possible postviral or vaccinal encephalitis (two). There were no focal neurological abnormalities and MRI and EEG tests were normal. Abnormal laboratory results were significantly raised urinary methylmalonic acid compared with age-matched controls (p=0.003), low haemoglobin in four children, and a low serum IgA in four children. Interpretation We identified associated gastrointestinal disease and developmental regression in a group of previously normal children, which was generally associated in time with possible environmental triggers.},

There are differences between the two disciplines in substantive interests and methodological traditions, however both have comprehensive perspectives and both are deeply concerned with the health, social, and economic well-being of human populations. One way to promote productive interdisciplinary research is to apply or develop scientific theories that exploit the complementary interests and methods of the two disciplines. Several candidate theories and themes are suggested here, including (1) the life course approach as applied to the biology of longevity; (2) the "modernized" Malthusian dilemma; (3) the demographic transition within developing countries; (4) the theory of evolution and its social and biological implications; (5) reciprocal effects of ecological and environmental characteristics on population health and well-being; and (6) systems theory as an approach to population complexity. Other approaches to fostering interdisciplinary investigation between these disciplines include joint course work, specifically targeted research funding initiatives and collaborative development of new population theory. The latter may be particularly important from several perspectives: uniting disciplines to jointly approach common and important scientific problems, providing existing frameworks with which to generate new scientific questions, and promoting enhanced scientific rigor by more tightly linking methods with hypotheses.},

   Abstract = {Mathematical models of transmission have become invaluable management tools in planning for the control of emerging infectious diseases. A key variable in such models is the reproductive number R. For new emerging infectious diseases, the value of the reproductive number can only be inferred indirectly from the observed exponential epidemic growth rate r. Such inference is ambiguous as several different equations exist that relate the reproductive number to the growth rate, and it is unclear which of these equations might apply to a new infection. Here, we show that these different equations differ only with respect to their assumed shape of the generation interval distribution. Therefore, the shape of the generation interval distribution determines which equation is appropriate for inferring the reproductive number from the observed growth rate. We show that by assuming all generation intervals to be equal to the mean, we obtain an upper bound to the range of possible values that the reproductive number may attain for a given growth rate. Furthermore, we show that by taking the generation interval distribution equal to the observed distribution, it is possible to obtain an empirical estimate of the reproductive number.},

The available epidemic curves for SARS show marked differences between the affected regions with respect to the total number of cases and epidemic duration, even for those regions in which outbreaks started almost simultaneously and similar control measures were implemented at the same time. The authors developed a likelihood-based estimation procedure that infers the temporal pattern of effective reproduction numbers from an observed epidemic curve. Precise estimates for the effective reproduction numbers were obtained by applying this estimation procedure to available data for SARS outbreaks that occurred in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada in 2003. The effective reproduction numbers revealed that epidemics in the various affected regions were characterized by markedly similar disease transmission potentials and similar levels of effectiveness of control measures. In controlling SARS outbreaks, timely alerts have been essential: Delaying the institution of control measures by 1 week would have nearly tripled the epidemic size and would have increased the expected epidemic duration by 4 weeks.},

   Abstract = {Aim: To report Australian parents' medication (paracetamol, ibuprofen and homeopathic) use in childhood fever management. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 401 Queensland parents of children aged between 6 months and 5 years recruited through advertising (48.4\%), face-to-face (26.4\%) and snowball (24.4\%) methods was conducted. A 17-item instrument was developed; construct and content validity were determined by an expert panel; and item reliability by test-retest with nine parents. Areas targeted were medication use and influences on and barriers to medication use. Results: Most participants were female, had tertiary education and lived in a major city (mean age 34.6 years). Reducing children's fever with over-the-counter medications was common (91\%): 94\% of parents reported using paracetamol and 77\% reported using ibuprofen. A few (3.7\%) used homeopathic remedies. Dosage was determined by weight (86.3\%), age (84.3\%), temperature (32.4\%), illness severity (31.4\%) and lethargy (20.9\%). Frequency was determined by instructions on the medication label (55.3\%), temperature (40.6\%) and well-being (27.7\%). Ibuprofen was administered too frequently by 31.5\% (four hourly by 22.8\%), and paracetamol by 3.8\%. Fifty-two per cent had alternated medications, 65.8\% of these for temperatures below 38.5 degrees C. Decisions to alternate were influenced by information from doctors/hospitals (49.5\%) and children remaining febrile post-antipyretic (41.7\%). Most parents reported over-the-counter medications as potentially harmful (73.2\%), citing liver (38.2\%), stomach (26.4\%) and kidney (18.6\%) damage and overdose (35.7\%) as concerns. When medications were refused or spat out (44.0\%), parents used force (62.4\%), different methods (29.5\%) or suppositories (20.8\%). Conclusions: Most parents used over-the-counter medications to reduce fever, often below 38.5 degrees C. The belief that these medications were harmful was overridden by fears of harmful outcomes from fever.},

   Pages = {631-357},
   Abstract = {Using the theory of coupled cell systems developed by Stewart, Golubitsky, Pivato and Torok, we consider patterns of synchrony in four types of planar lattice dynamical systems: square lattice and hexagonal lattice differential equations with nearest neighbour coupling and with nearest and next nearest neighbour couplings. Patterns of synchrony are flow-invariant subspaces for all lattice dynamical systems with a given network architecture that are formed by setting coordinates in different cells equal. Such patterns can be formed by symmetry (through fixed-point subspaces), but many patterns cannot be obtained in this way. Indeed, Golubitsky, Nicol and Stewart present patterns of synchrony on square lattice that are not predicted by symmetry. The general theory shows that finding patterns of synchrony is equivalent to finding balanced equivalence relations on the set of cells. In a two-colour pattern one set of cells is coloured white and the complement black. Two-colour patterns in lattice dynamical systems are balanced if the number of white cells connected to a white cell is the same for all white cells and the number of black cells connected to a black cell is the same for all black cells. In this paper, we find all two-colour patterns of synchrony of the four kinds of lattice dynamical systems, and show that all of these patterns, including spatially complicated patterns, can be generated from a finite number of distinct patterns. Our classification shows that all balanced two-colourings in lattice systems with both nearest and next nearest neighbour couplings are spatially doubly periodic. We also prove that equilibria associated with each such two-colour pattern can be obtained by codimension one synchrony-breaking bifurcation from a fully synchronous equilibrium.},

   Abstract = {The basic reproduction ratio and its computation formulae are established for a 
large class of compartmental epidemic models in periodic environments. It is proved that a 
disease cannot invade the disease-free state if the ratio is less than unity and can invade if it is 
greater than unity. It is also shown that the basic reproduction number of the time-averaged 
autonomous system is applicable in the case where both the matrix of new infection rate and 
the matrix of transition and dissipation within infectious compartments are diagonal, but it 
may underestimate and overestimate infection risks in other cases. The global dynamics of 
a periodic epidemic model with patch structure is analyzed in order to study the impact of 
periodic contacts or periodic migrations on the disease transmission. },

   Pages = {11157-11162},
   Abstract = { Although population structure has long been recognized as relevant to the spread of infectious disease, traditional mathematical models have understated the role of nonhomogenous mixing in populations with geographical and social structure. Recently, a wide variety of spatial and network models have been proposed that incorporate various aspects of interaction structure among individuals. However, these more complex models necessarily suffer from limited tractability, rendering general conclusions difficult to draw. In seeking a compromise between parsimony and realism, we introduce a class of metapopulation models in which we assume homogeneous mixing holds within local contexts, and that these contexts are embedded in a nested hierarchy of successively larger domains. We model the movement of individuals between contexts via simple transport parameters and allow diseases to spread stochastically. Our model exhibits some important stylized features of real epidemics, including extreme size variation and temporal heterogeneity, that are difficult to characterize with traditional measures. In particular, our results suggest that when epidemics do occur the basic reproduction number R0 may bear little relation to their final size. Informed by our model's behavior, we suggest measures for characterizing epidemic thresholds and discuss implications for the control of epidemics. },

   Abstract = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators(1-4), Josephson junction arrays(5,6), excitable media(7), neural networks(8-10), spatial games(11), genetic control networks(12) and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon(13,14) (popularly known as six degrees of separation(15)). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

At the same time, an old foe has again raised its head, reminding us that our worst nightmare may not be a new one. In 2003, highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza virus, including the H5N1 and H7N7 subtypes, again crossed from birds to humans and caused fatal disease. Direct avian-to-human influenza transmission was unknown before 1997. Have we responded to these threats by better preparing for emerging disease agents, or are we continuing to act only as crises arise? Here we consider progress to date in preparedness for an influenza pandemic and review what remains to be done. We conclude by prioritizing the remaining needs and exploring the reasons for our current lack of preparedness for an influenza pandemic.},

   Pages = {152-179},
   Abstract = {In this review we examine the hypothesis that aquatic birds are the primordial source of all influenza viruses in other species and study the ecological features that permit the perpetuation of influenza viruses in aquatic avian species. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence of influenza A virus RNA segments coding for the spike proteins (HA, NA, and M2) and the internal proteins (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS) from a wide range of hosts, geographical regions, and influenza A virus subtypes support the following conclusions. (i) Two partly overlapping reservoirs of influenza A viruses exist in migrating waterfowl and shorebirds throughout the world. These species harbor influenza viruses of all the known HA and NA subtypes. (ii) Influenza viruses have evolved into a number of host-specific lineages that are exemplified by the NP gene and include equine Prague/56, recent equine strains, classical swine and human strains, H13 gull strains, and all other avian strains. Other genes show similar patterns, but with extensive evidence of genetic reassortment. Geographical as well as host-specific lineages are evident. (iii) All of the influenza A viruses of mammalian sources originated from the avian gene pool, and it is possible that influenza B viruses also arose from the same source. (iv) The different virus lineages are predominantly host specific, but there are periodic exchanges of influenza virus genes on whole viruses between species, giving rise to pandemics of disease in humans, lower animals, and birds. (v) The influenza viruses currently circulating in humans and pigs in North America originated by transmission of all genes from the avian reservoir prior to the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic; some of the genes have subsequently been replaced by others from the influenza gene pool in birds. (vi) The influenza virus gene pool in aquatic birds of the world is probably perpetuated by low-level transmission within that species throughout the year. (vii) There is evidence that most new human pandemic strains and variants have originated in southern China. (viii) There is speculation that pigs may serve as the intermediate host in genetic exchange between influenza viruses in avian and humans, but experimental evidence is lacking. (ix) Once the ecological properties of influenza viruses are understood, it may be possible to interdict the introduction of new influenza viruses into humans.},

   Abstract = {Influenza A viruses continue to emerge from the aquatic avian reservoir and cause pandemics. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence of all eight influenza A virus RNA segments indicates that all of the influenza viruses in mammalian hosts originate from the avian gene pool. In contrast to the rapid progressive changes in both the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of mammalian virus gene lineages, avian virus genes show far less variation and, in most cases, appear to be in evolutionary stasis. There are periodic exchanges of influenza virus genes or whole viruses between species giving rise to pandemics of diseases in humans, lower animals and birds. The periodic emergence of influenza viruses in mammalian species has been illustrated by the appearance of a new influenza virus in horses in northern China in 1989. Phylogenetic analysis of classical H1N1, avian-like H1N1 and human H3N2 viruses circulating in Italian pigs reveals that genetic reassortment is taking place between avian- and human-like viruses in the European pig population. These studies provide evidence supporting the possibility that pigs serve as a mixing vessel for reassortment between influenza viruses in mammalian and avian hosts and raise the question of whether the next pandemic of influenza will emerge in Europe!},

We tested this idea under conditions that control for confounding factors. Donations were more frequent to receivers who had been generous to others in earlier interactions. This shows that image scoring promotes cooperative behavior in situations where direct reciprocity is unlikely.},

   Abstract = {Scientific and ethical theories are examined in terms of the practice of epidemiology, the study of the determinants and distributions of disease, and the application of the knowledge gained to prevent disease and improve the health of populations. Scientific theories provide explanations and predictions for epidemiologic studies of disease etiology and prevention. Causal theory is the key example for epidemiologic science, although theories of selection processes, theories of health, and theories of probability and statistics are also core. Theories of ethics provide principles, warrants, and methods for acting upon the knowledge gained in the scientific pursuits of epidemiology and for obtaining that knowledge appropriately. Ethical theories guide practitioners in making justified decisions about when and under what conditions public health interventions should be undertaken and how research participants should be treated. Theories of midlevel bioethical principles have received the most attention in epidemiology, but other theories, such as virtue theory and communitarian theory, are also relevant. Many theories matter to the practice of epidemiology: theories of biology, aging, evolution, and medicine; theories of history, religion, law, economics, and politics, as well as the theories of the physical, behavioral, and social sciences. These theories matter because epidemiologists study many different biological and social phenomena, and preventive interventions occur at many different levels of explanation. Development of theory is not a high priority in contemporary epidemiology. Identifying the responsibilities of the discipline to be public health intervention and rigorous science is a first step toward developing and applying theory in epidemiology.},

   Abstract = {Knowledge of tumor growth is important in the planning and evaluation of screening programs, clinical trials, and epidemiological studies. Studies of tumor growth rates in humans are usually based on small and selected samples. In the present study based on the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program, tumor growth was estimated from a large population using a new estimating procedure/model.
A likelihood-based estimating procedure was used, where both tumor growth and the screen test sensitivity were modeled as continuously increasing functions of tumor size. The method was applied to cancer incidence and tumor measurement data from 395,188 women aged 50 to 69 years.
Tumor growth varied considerably between subjects, with 5% of tumors taking less than 1.2 months to grow from 10 mm to 20 mm in diameter, and another 5% taking more than 6.3 years. The mean time a tumor needed to grow from 10 mm to 20 mm in diameter was estimated as 1.7 years, increasing with age. The screen test sensitivity was estimated to increase sharply with tumor size, rising from 26% at 5 mm to 91% at 10 mm. Compared with previously used Markov models for tumor progression, the applied model gave considerably higher model fit (85% increased predictive power) and provided estimates directly linked to tumor size.
Screening data with tumor measurements can provide population-based estimates of tumor growth and screen test sensitivity directly linked to tumor size. There is a large variation in breast cancer tumor growth, with faster growth among younger women.},

Its common-sense definition turns out to have deficiencies which are illustrated by various explicit examples.  Part of the ambiguities are shown to have their origin in the difficulty of transferring the concept of independent constants of motion into quantum mechanics, due to a fundamental theorem on sets of commuting operators by von Neumann.  Taking into account the classical limit with coherent states does not resolve the problems.  As a result, it is pointed out why the appealing phenomenological distinction between regular and chaotic quantum systems cannot be traced back to the present notion of ``quantum integrability'' in a mathematically rigorous way.},

   Abstract = {The local structure of the Galactic disk is similar to that of a self-gravitating one-dimensional slab.  Such a slab may have discrete oscillation modes.  This implies that a disk will not necessarily reach a new time-independent equilibrium state after a perturbation but may exhibit undamped oscillation.

The possible oscillation modes and their frequencies are derived for three families of one-dimensional disk models with and without extenal halos.  In the presence of a halo, the lowest order mode is a sloshing or seiche mode and corresponds to oscillation of the entire slab in the halo background potential.  This oscillation is undamped and may be excited to large [O(1)] amplitudes.  Symmetric breathing modes predicted by the linear theory may be excited to 3\% amplitude before their natural widths are sufficient to cause the mode to damp.  Higher order modes damp at lower limiting amplitudes.  I also consider modes with horizontal as well as vertical structure.  The lowest order mode generalizes to a bending wave which is weakly damped for long wavelengths.

The lowest order seiche mode was easily excited in a $n$-body simulation by passing projectiles (star clusters, dwarf galaxies), suggesting that the effects of this mode might be observable in the Galactic disk.  In particular, it is possible that the associated long-wavelength bending modes, as excited by the Magellanic Clouds, for example, are related to the Galactic warp.  Attempts to produce the higher order oscillations failed.  Although it is possible that higher order modes may exist in galactic disks, they do not appear to be easily excited by a large-scale perturbation.  The effect of small-scale perturbations has not been investigated.  Implication for the often-used isthermal approximation are discussed.},

The use of prioritization (based on disease stage and/or age) at both queues, and the development and deployment of modestly rapid and sensitive biosensors, while helpful, produce only second-order improvements.},

   Journal = {Experimental Gerontology},
   Volume = {37},
   Number = {5},
   Pages = {615-627},
   Abstract = {Antagonistic pleiotropy, the evolutionary theory of senescence, posits that age related somatic decline is the inevitable late-life by-product of adaptations that increase fitness in early life. That concept, coupled with recent findings in oncology and gerontology, provides the foundation for an integrative theory of vertebrate senescence that reconciles aspects of the 'accumulated damage' 'metabolic rate', and 'oxidative stress' models. We hypothesize that (1) in vertebrates, a telomeric fail-safe inhibits tumor formation by limiting cellular proliferation. (2) The same system results in the progressive degradation of tissue function with age, (3) These patterns are manifestations of an evolved antagonistic pleiotropy in which extrinsic causes of mortality favor a species-optimal balance between tumor suppression and tissue repair. (4) With that trade-off as a fundamental constraint, selection adjusts telomere lengths-longer telomeres increasing the capacity for repair, shorter telomeres increasing tumor resistance. (5) In environments where extrinsically induced mortality is frequent, selection against senescence is comparatively weak as few individuals live long enough to suffer a substantial phenotypic decline. The weaker the selection against senescence, the further the optimal balance point moves toward shorter telomeres and increased tumor suppression. The stronger the selection against senescence, the farther the optimal balance point moves toward longer telomeres, increasing the capacity for tissue repair, slowing senescence and elevating tumor risks. (6) In iteroparous organisms selection tends to coordinate rates of senescence between tissues, such that no one organ generally limits life-span. A subsidiary hypothesis argues that senescent decline is the combined effect of (1) uncompensated cellular attrition and (2) increasing histological entropy. Entropy increases due to a loss of the intra-tissue positional information that normally regulates cell fate and function. Informational loss is subject to positive feedback, producing the ever-accelerating pattern of senescence characteristic of iteroparous vertebrates. Though telomere erosion begins early in development, the onset of senescence should, on average, be deferred to the species-typical age of first reproduction, the balance point at which selection on this trade-off should allow exhaustion of replicative capacity to overtake some cell lines. We observe that captive-rodent breeding protocols, designed to increase reproductive output, simultaneously exert strong selection against reproductive senescence and virtually eliminate selection that would otherwise favor tumor suppression. This appears to have greatly elongated the telomeres of laboratory mice. With their telomeric failsafe effectively disabled, these animals are unreliable models of normal senescence and tumor formation. Safety tests employing these animals likely overestimate cancer risks and underestimate tissue damage and consequent accelerated senescence. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

Neglecting one’s own preferences and following a leader is one way to resolve this coordination problem. But what attributes make an individual a 'leader'?

   Abstract = {When the relative fitness of mate and female offspring varies with environmental conditions, evolutionary theory predicts that parents should adjust the sex of their offspring accordingly. Qualitative and even quantitative support for this prediction is striking in some taxa but much less convincing in others. Explaining such variation across taxa in the fit of sex ratio theory remains a major challenge. We use meta-analysis to test the role of two constraints in the evolution of sex ratios. Based on analysis of sex ratio skews in birds and wasps, we show that (i) mechanisms of sex determination do not necessarily constrain the evolution of sex ratio adjustment, and (ii) parental ability to predict their offsprings' environment influences the evolution of sex ratio patterns across taxa. More generally, our results show that multiple constraints may determine the precision of adaptation.},

It is shown that particle noise and relaxation are equivalent in disk simulations and that some calculations have been seriously affected by them.  However, the best simulations are almost free of relaxation effects.  The ``noise'' in real galaxies is also discussed and may be nonnegligible.  Relaxation is an important but controllable problem for N-body simulation of disks, and some of the confusion about the criteria for global stability of disks may have resulted from spurious results caused by relaxation.  Some simple analytical and numerical tests for relaxation are proposed which could be used as diagnostics for simulations in order to avoid these problems in the future.},

Clinical follow-up of vaccinees revealed that 2.1 and 2.4% of vaccinees developed modified cases of varicella in the first and second years, respectively, after vaccination. Most of those who developed varicella postvaccination had an attenuated illness, characterized by fewer lesions and a lower incidence of fever (greater-than-or- equal-to 100-degrees-F, oral) than after natural infection. The likelihood of developing varicella postvaccination decreased (P < 0.0001) as the 6-week postvaccination glycoprotein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titer increased. In addition the number of lesions in these cases tended to decrease (P = 0.07 for Year 1 and P = 0.02 for Year 2) as the 6-week glycoprotein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titer increased. Thus the 6-week postvaccination glycoprotein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titer can be used as a surrogate marker for protection from natural disease.},

   Abstract = {A well-known result from the theory of the evolution of virulence is the prediction that the virulence of a pathogen (i.e. the rate of parasite-induced host mortality) always evolves to higher levels when host background mortality rates increase. This prediction, however, is derived from models that assume that host mortality sources combine additively to determine the overall host mortality rate. In this paper, we suggest that such additivity is probably rare for many host- pathogen systems, and explore how the predictions for the evolution of virulence are altered when interactions between host mortality sources are incorporated into the theory. Our results indicate that if mortality-source interactions are sufficiently strong then the evolutionarily stable level of virulence can actually decrease as the background mortality rate increases. Consequently, a detailed mechanistic description of how parasites and other mortality sources combine to cause host mortality is re!  quired before reliable predictions about virulence evolution can be made. Moreover, mortality-source interactions make empirical comparisons of the virulence of different parasites a much more subtle issue.},

   Number = {7},
   Pages = {1478-1488},
   Abstract = {Most theoretical work on the evolution of senescence has assumed that all individuals within a population are equally susceptible to extrinsic sources of mortality. An influential qualitative prediction based on this assumption is Williams's hypothesis, which states that more rapid senescence is expected to evolve when the magnitude of such extrinsic mortality sources is increased. Much evidence suggests, however, that for many groups of organisms externally imposed mortality risk is a function of an organism's internal condition and hence susceptibility to such hazards. Here we use a model of antagonistic pleiotropy to investigate the consequences that such interactions (between environmental hazard and internal condition) can have for Williams's hypothesis. As with some previous theory examining noninteractive extrinsic mortality sources, we find that an increase in interactive extrinsic sources of mortality makes it less likely that an individual will survive from birt!  h to any given age, weakening selection against physiological deterioration at all ages and thus favoring more rapid senescence. However, an increase in interactive mortality sources also typically strengthens selection against physiological deterioration at any age, given an individual has survived to that age, because it reduces the fitness of poor-condition individuals more than good-condition individuals. These opposing effects are not felt equally at all ages, with the latter predominating at early ages. The combined effects can therefore result in the novel prediction that an increase in interactive extrinsic mortality sources can select for slower senescent deterioration early in life but more rapid deterioration late in life.},

Anthropologists and sociologists have speculated that rituals involving synchronous activity may produce positive emotions that weaken the psychological boundaries between the self and the group. This article explores whether synchronous activity may serve as a partial solution to the free-rider problem facing groups that need to motivate their members to contribute toward the collective good. Across three experiments, people acting in synchrony with others cooperated more in subsequent group economic exercises, even in situations requiring personal sacriﬁce. Our results also showed that positive emotions need not be generated for synchrony to foster cooperation. In total, the results suggest that acting in synchrony with others can increase cooperation by strengthening social attachment among group members. },

   Title = {Long intervals of stasis punctuated by bursts of positive selection in the seasonal evolution of influenza A virus},
   Journal = {Biology Direct},
   Volume = {1},
   Number = {34},
   Abstract = {Background

The interpandemic evolution of the influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein is commonly considered a paragon of rapid evolutionary change under positive selection in which amino acid replacements are fixed by virtue of their effect on antigenicity, enabling the virus to evade immune surveillance.

Results

We performed phylogenetic analyses of the recently obtained large and relatively unbiased samples of the HA sequences from 1995–2005 isolates of the H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes of influenza A virus. Unexpectedly, it was found that the evolution of H3N2 HA includes long intervals of generally neutral sequence evolution without apparent substantial antigenic change ("stasis" periods) that are characterized by an excess of synonymous over nonsynonymous substitutions per site, lack of association of amino acid replacements with epitope regions, and slow extinction of coexisting virus lineages. These long periods of stasis are punctuated by shorter intervals of rapid evolution under positive selection during which new dominant lineages quickly displace previously coexisting ones. The preponderance of positive selection during intervals of rapid evolution is supported by the dramatic excess of amino acid replacements in the epitope regions of HA compared to replacements in the rest of the HA molecule. In contrast, the stasis intervals showed a much more uniform distribution of replacements over the HA molecule, with a statistically significant difference in the rate of synonymous over nonsynonymous substitution in the epitope regions between the two modes of evolution. A number of parallel amino acid replacements – the same amino acid substitution occurring independently in different lineages – were also detected in H3N2 HA. These parallel mutations were, largely, associated with periods of rapid fitness change, indicating that there are major limitations on evolutionary pathways during antigenic change. The finding that stasis is the prevailing modality of H3N2 evolution suggests that antigenic changes that lead to an increase in fitness typically result from epistatic interactions between several amino acid substitutions in the HA and, perhaps, other viral proteins. The strains that become dominant due to increased fitness emerge from low frequency strains thanks to the last amino acid replacement that completes the set of replacements required to produce a significant antigenic change; no subset of substitutions results in a biologically significant antigenic change and corresponding fitness increase. In contrast to H3N2, no clear intervals of evolution under positive selection were detected for the H1N1 HA during the same time span. Thus, the ascendancy of H1N1 in some seasons is, most likely, caused by the drop in the relative fitness of the previously prevailing H3N2 lineages as the fraction of susceptible hosts decreases during the stasis intervals.

Conclusion

We show that the common view of the evolution of influenza virus as a rapid, positive selection-driven process is, at best, incomplete. Rather, the interpandemic evolution of influenza appears to consist of extended intervals of stasis, which are characterized by neutral sequence evolution, punctuated by shorter intervals of rapid fitness increase when evolutionary change is driven by positive selection. These observations have implications for influenza surveillance and vaccine formulation; in particular, the possibility exists that parallel amino acid replacements could serve as a predictor of new dominant strains.},

   Title = {Has the 2005 measles mortality reduction goal been achieved? A natural history modelling study},
   Journal = {the lancet},
   Volume = {369},
   Pages = {191-200},
   Abstract = {Background In 2002, the UN General Assembly Special Session on Children adopted a goal to reduce deaths owing to measles by half by the end of 2005, compared with 1999 estimates. We describe eff orts and progress made towards this goal. 

Methods We assessed trends in immunisation against measles on the basis of national implementation of the WHO/ UNICEF comprehensive strategy for measles mortality reduction, and the provision of a second opportunity for measles immunisation. We used a natural history model to evaluate trends in mortality due to measles. 

Results Between 1999 and 2005, according to our model mortality owing to measles was reduced by 60%, from an estimated 873 000 deaths (uncertainty bounds 634 000–1 140 000) in 1999 to 345 000 deaths (247 000–458 000) in 2005. The largest percentage reduction in estimated measles mortality during this period was in the western Pacifi c region (81%), followed by Africa (75%) and the eastern Mediterranean region (62%). Africa achieved the largest total reduction, contributing 72% of the global reduction in measles mortality. Nearly 7·5 million deaths from measles were prevented through immunisation between 1999 and 2005, with supplemental immunisation activities and improved routine immunisation accounting for 2·3 million of these prevented deaths. 

Interpretation The achievement of the 2005 global measles mortality reduction goal is evidence of what can be accomplished for child survival in countries with high childhood mortality when safe, cost-eff ective, and affordable interventions are backed by country-level political commitment and an eff ective international partnership.},

   Journal = {Siam Journal On Applied Mathematics},
   Volume = {57},
   Number = {5},
   Pages = {1281-1310},
   Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a two species competition model in a chemostat that uses a distributed delay to model the lag in the process of nutrient conversion and study the global asymptotic behavior of the model. The model includes a washout factor over the time delay involved in the nutrient conversion, and hence the delay is distributed over the species concentrations as well as over the nutrient concentration (using the gamma distribution). The results are valid for a very general class of monotone growth response functions. By using the linear chain trick technique and the fluctuation lemma, we completely determine the global limiting behavior of the model, prove that there is always at most one survivor, and give a criterion to predict the outcome that is dependent upon the parameters in the delay kernel. We compare these predictions on the qualitative outcome of competition introduced by including distributed delay in the model with the predictions made by the corresponding discrete delay model, as well as with the corresponding no delay ODEs model. We show that the discrete delay model and the corresponding ODEs model can be obtained as limiting cases of the distributed delay models. Also, provided that the mean delays are small, the predictions of the delay models are almost identical with the predictions given by the ODEs model. However, when the mean delays are significant, the predictions given by the delay models concerning which species wins the competition and avoids extinction can be different from each other or from the predictions of the corresponding ODEs model. By varying the parameters in the delay kernels, we find that the model seems to have more potential to mimic reality. For example, computer simulations indicate that the larger the mean delay of the losing species, the more quickly that species proceeds toward extinction.},

The model incorporates discrete time delays to describe the delay in the conversion of nutrient consumed to viable biomass and hence includes delays simultaneously in variables of nutrient and species concentrations. In the case where only two species are engaged in competition, it is shown that competitive exclusion holds for any monotone growth response functions. Sufficient conditions are also obtained for the model to exhibit competitive exclusion in the n-species case. In regard to the delay effects on the qualitative outcome of competition, it is demonstrated that when the delays are relatively small, the predictions of the model are identical with the predictions given by corresponding models without time delays. However, including large delays in the model may alter the predicted outcome of competition. The techniques used also work when different removal rates are permitted, and in this case there are even new results in the no-delay case.},

   Journal = {Nature},
   Volume = {466},
   Pages = {1102-1104},
   Abstract = {Chaotic ecological dynamic systems defy conventional statistical analysis. Systems with near-chaotic dynamics are little better. Such systems are almost invariably driven by endogenous dynamic processes plus demographic and environmental process noise, and are only observable with error. Their sensitivity to history means that minute changes in the driving noise realization, or the system parameters, will cause drastic changes in the system trajectory 1. This sensitivity is inherited and amplified by the joint probability density of the observable data and the process noise, rendering it useless as the basis for obtaining measures of statistical fit. Because the joint density is the basis for the fit measures used by all conventional statistical methods 2, this is a major theoretical shortcoming. The inability to make well-founded statistical inferences about biological dynamic models in the chaotic and near-chaotic regimes, other than on an ad hoc basis, leaves dynamic theory without the methods of quantitative validation that are essential tools in the rest of biological science. Here I show that this impasse can be resolved in a simple and general manner, using a method that requires only the ability to simulate the observed data on a system from the dynamic model about which inferences are required. The raw data series are reduced to phase-insensitive summary statistics, quantifying local dynamic structure and the distribution of observations. Simulation is used to obtain the mean and the covariance matrix of the statistics, given model parameters, allowing the construction of a ‘synthetic likelihood’ that assesses model fit. This likelihood can be explored using a straightforward Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, but one further post-processing step returns pure likelihood-based inference. I apply the method to establish the dynamic nature of the fluctuations in Nicholson’s classic blowfly experiments 3–5.},

   Abstract = {Aims To test, by completion of a simple questionnaire, patient knowledge of whether 15 commonly used over-the- counter and prescription analgesics and cough/cold remedies contained paracetamol and patient knowledge of the 4 g maximum daily dose of paracetamol. Methods Patients in the emergency department triage waiting area of a busy London teaching hospital were asked to complete a standardised one-page questionnaire. From a list of 15 commonly used over-the-counter and prescription products, patients were asked which contained paracetamol, responding 'yes', 'no' or 'not sure' for each. They were also asked to state the recommended maximum daily dose of paracetamol. Results 910 patients were enrolled in the study (mean age 39 years, 53\% women). The mean +/- SD score was 6.5 +/- 2.5. The maximum score was 14 (n = 2) and the minimum score was 0 (n = 11). For the recommended maximum daily dose, 93.7\% (n = 853) of patients gave an answer. Of these, 53.8\% answered correctly, 4.7\% quoted a supratherapeutic dose and 41.5\% a subtherapeutic dose. Conclusions Patient knowledge of paracetamol-containing products and of the maximum daily dose is currently insufficient to ensure safe use of the drug. Interventions are required to address these knowledge gaps to prevent unintentional repeated supratherapeutic ingestion of paracetamol. These interventions could include targeted public education and/or appropriate and effective medication labelling.},

   Number = {8},
   Pages = {768-75},
   Abstract = {BACKGROUND: A decade ago, the administrative costs of health care in the United States greatly exceeded those in Canada. We investigated whether the ascendancy of computerization, managed care, and the adoption of more businesslike approaches to health care have decreased administrative costs. METHODS: For the United States and Canada, we calculated the administrative costs of health insurers, employers' health benefit programs, hospitals, practitioners' offices, nursing homes, and home care agencies in 1999. We analyzed published data, surveys of physicians, employment data, and detailed cost reports filed by hospitals, nursing homes, and home care agencies. In calculating the administrative share of health care spending, we excluded retail pharmacy sales and a few other categories for which data on administrative costs were unavailable. We used census surveys to explore trends over time in administrative employment in health care settings. Costs are reported in U.S. dollars. RESULTS: In 1999, health administration costs totaled at least 294.3 billion dollars in the United States, or 1,059 dollars per capita, as compared with 307 dollars per capita in Canada. After exclusions, administration accounted for 31.0 percent of health care expenditures in the United States and 16.7 percent of health care expenditures in Canada. Canada's national health insurance program had overhead of 1.3 percent; the overhead among Canada's private insurers was higher than that in the United States (13.2 percent vs. 11.7 percent). Providers' administrative costs were far lower in Canada. Between 1969 and 1999, the share of the U.S. health care labor force accounted for by administrative workers grew from 18.2 percent to 27.3 percent. In Canada, it grew from 16.0 percent in 1971 to 19.1 percent in 1996. (Both nations' figures exclude insurance-industry personnel.) CONCLUSIONS: The gap between U.S. and Canadian spending on health care administration has grown to 752 dollars per capita. A large sum might be saved in the United States if administrative costs could be trimmed by implementing a Canadian-style health care system.},

During the Bureau's history Canada has developed from a country dependent on a staple economy to a mature industrial power poised at the brink of the information era. Information needs have mushroomed in both quantity and complexity; at the same time the technology for gathering, compiling, analysing, and disseminating information has been revolutionized.

   Journal = {Animal Behaviour},
   Volume = {62},
   Pages = {973-979},
   Abstract = {Cooperative sentinel behaviour in Arabian babblers, Turdoides squamiceps, appears generally consistent with state-dependent models of individually selfish antipredator behaviour. We examined further detailed aspects of this cooperative behaviour, including the suggestion that by engaging in this behaviour sentinels advertise their status and gain social prestige. Chosen sentinel locations were higher, but no more exposed, than the best alternative locations within 25 m. Sentinels started off closer to the centre of the foraging group than when sentinel bouts were terminated. Change-overs between sentinels were nearly always due to previous sentinels terminating their own bout. On the rare occasions when bouts were interrupted by upcoming sentinels, physical contact or aggression was extremely rare. Dominant males tended to terminate sentinel bouts of other birds, interrupting especially the dominant females. Other than this, there was no effect of an individual's sex or dominance rank on any aspect of sentinel change-overs or location choice when acting as a sentinel. There were also no differences in any sentinel activity between simple family groups, and those more complex nonfamily groups within which individuals compete for reproduction. Rates of alarm calling did not differ between group members, although dominant males did make more territorial calls to neighbouring groups while acting as a sentinel. Therefore, we found relatively little evidence that individuals compete for the chance to act as a sentinel as a means of showing off within groups of Arabian babblers. Instead, our study confirms the primary function of sentinels as a system of cooperative vigilance. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Statistically, the time-averaged position and velocity densities are shown to approach their respective microcanonical ensemble averages for four, five, and six particles.  The relaxation time is much longer than previously expected.  For three particles the system does not relax to the microcanonical distribution.  We have explored the surface of sections for the $N=3$  case and have correlated the statistical properties with explicit dynamical features.  We show that this dynamical method is consistent with the statistical interpretation.  The mechanism which generates the chaotic behavior for the $N=3$ case is multiple encounters.},

   Abstract = {Over the years, plague has caused a large number of deaths worldwide and subsequently changed history, not the least during the period of the Black Death. Of the three plague pandemics, the third is believed to have originated in China. Using the spatial and temporal human plague records in China from 1850 to 1964, we investigated the association of human plague intensity (plague cases per year) with proxy data on climate condition (specifically an index for dryness/wetness). Our modeling analysis demonstrates that the responses of plague intensity to dry/wet conditions were different in northern and southern China. In northern China, plague intensity generally increased when wetness increased, for both the current and the previous year, except for low intensity during extremely wet conditions in the current year (reflecting a dome-shaped response to current-year dryness/ wetness). In southern China, plague intensity generally decreased when wetness increased, except for high intensity during extremely wet conditions of the current year. These opposite effects are likely related to the different climates and rodent communities in the two parts of China: In northern China (arid climate), rodents are expected to respond positively to high precipitation, whereas in southern China (humid climate), high precipitation is likely to have a negative effect. Our results suggest that associations between human plague intensity and precipitation are nonlinear: positive in dry conditions, but negative in wet conditions.},

We estimated the basic reproductive number, R0, to range from 1.3 to 1.7 and the generation interval to range from 2.6 to 3.2 days. We used a simulation model to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination strategies in the United States for fall 2009. If a vaccine were available soon enough, vaccination of children, followed by adults, reaching 70\% overall coverage, in addition to high-risk and essential workforce groups, could mitigate a severe epidemic.},

   Journal = {Journal of theoretical biology},
   Volume = {206},
   Pages = {539-560},
   Abstract = {Helper T (Th) cells are a crucial component of the adaptive immune system and are of 
fundamental importance in orchestrating the appropriate response to pathogenic challenge. 
They fall into two broad categories de"ned by the cytokines each produces. Th1 cells produce 
interferon-y and are required for e!ective immunity to intracellular bacteria, viruses and 
protozoa whereas Th2 produce IL-4 and are required for optimal antibody production to 
T-dependent antigens. A great deal of experimental data on the regulation of Th1 and Th2 
differentiation have been obtained but many essential features of this complex system are still 
not understood. Here we present a mathematical model of Th1/Th2 differentiation and cross 
regulation. We model Fas-mediated activation-induced cell death (AICD) as this process has 
been identified as an important mechanism for limiting clonal expansion and resolving T cell 
responses. We conclude that Th2 susceptibility to AICD is important for stabilizing the two 
polarized arms of the T helper response, and that cell-cell killing, not suicide, is the dominant 
mechanism for Fas-mediated death of Th1 effectors. We find that the combination of the 
anti-proliferative effect of the cytokine TGF-B and the inhibiting influence of IL-10 on T cell 
activation are crucial controls for Th2 populations. We see that the strengths of the activation 
signals for each T helper cell subset, which are dependent on the antigen dose, co-stimulatory 
signals and the cytokine environment, critically determine the dominant helper subset. 
Switches from Th1- to Th2-dominance may be important in chronic infection and we show 
that this phenomenon can arise from differential AICD susceptibility of T helper subsets, and 
asymmetries in the nature of the cross-suppressive cytokine interactions. Our model suggests 
that in some senses a predominantly type 2 reaction may well be the "default'' pathway for an 
antigen-specific immune response, due to these asymmetries. },

   Abstract = {The process of adaptation occurs on two timescales. In the short term, natural selection merely sorts the variation already present in a population, whereas in the longer term genotypes quite different from any that were initially present evolve through the cumulation of new mutations. The first process is described by the mathematical theory of population genetics. However, this theory begins by defining a fixed set of genotypes and cannot provide a satisfactory analysis of the second process because it does not permit any genuinely new type to arise. The evolutionary outcome of selection acting on novel variation arising over long periods is therefore difficult to predict. The classical problem of this kind is whether 'replaying the tape of life' would invariably lead to the familiar organisms of the modern biota(1,2). Here we study the long-term behaviour of populations of autonomously replicating computer programs and find that the same type, introduced into the same simple environment, evolves on any given occasion along a unique trajectory towards one of many well-adapted end points.},

Determining the minimum dose of virus particles that can initiate infection, termed the minimum infective dose (MID), is important for the development of risk assessment models in the fields of food and water treatment and the implementation of appropriate infection control strategies in healthcare settings. Both respiratory and enteric viruses can be shed at high titers from infected individuals even when the infection is asymptomatic. Presence of pre-existing antibodies has been shown to affect the infectious dose and to be protective against reinfection for many, but not all viruses. Most respiratory viruses appear to be as infective in humans as in tissue culture. Doses of < 1 TCID(50) of influenza virus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus were reported to infect 50\% of the tested population. Similarly, low doses of the enteric viruses, norovirus, rotavirus, echovirus, poliovirus, and hepatitis A virus, caused infection in at least some of the volunteers tested. A number of factors may influence viruses' infectivity in experimentally infected human volunteers. These include host and pathogen factors as well as the experimental methodology. As a result, the reported infective doses of human viruses have to be interpreted with caution.},

   Pages = {377-387},
   Abstract = { In this paper, we examine the effects of patch number and different dispersal patterns on dynamics of local populations and on the level of synchrony between them. Local population renewal is governed by the Ricker model and we also consider asymmetrical dispersal as well as the presence of environmental heterogeneity. Our results show that both population dynamics and the level of synchrony differ markedly between two and a larger number of local populations. For two patches different dispersal rules give very versatile dynamics. However, for a larger number of local populations the dynamics are similar irrespective of the dispersal rule. For example, for the parameter values yielding stable or periodic dynamics in a single population, the dynamics do not change when the patches are coupled with dispersal. High intensity of dispersal does not guarantee synchrony between local populations. The level of synchrony depends also on dispersal rule, the number of local populations, and the intrinsic rate of increase. In our study, the effects of density-independent and density-dependent dispersal rules do not show any consistent difference. The results call for caution when drawing general conclusions from models of only two interacting populations and question the applicability of a large number of theoretical papers dealing with two local populations.

The clustering of cases within social groups is proposed to account for these differences in the contact rates and for other empirical observations. The irregularity of outbreaks of measles in cities of fewer than two million people can be explained by stochastic effects.

   Journal = {Clinical Neurophysiology},
   Volume = {110},
   Number = {10},
   Pages = {1717-1725},
   Abstract = {Objective: Previous coherence studies of human intracranial electroencephalograms (EEGs) can be faulted on two methodological issues: (I) coherence estimates in a majority were formed from a very small number of independent sample spectra, and (2) the statistical significance of coherence estimates was either not reported or was poorly evaluated. Coherence estimator performance may be poor when a small number of independent sample spectra are employed, and the coupling of poor estimation and statistical testing can result in inaccuracy in the measurement of coherence. The performance characteristics of the coherence estimator and statistical testing of coherence estimates are described in this manuscript. Methods: The bias, variance, probability density functions, and confidence intervals of the estimate of magnitude squared coherence (MSC); and power analysis for the test of zero MSC were developed from the exact analytic form of the probability density function of the estimate of MSC for Gaussian random processes. The coherence of a single epoch of background EEG, recorded from a patient with intractable seizures, was evaluated with different parameter values to aid in the exposition of the concepts developed here. Results: The statistical characteristics of WOSA coherence estimates are a function of a single estimator parameter, the number of independent sample spectra employed in the estimation. Bias and variance are high, confidence intervals may be large, and the probability of Type II errors is high if a small number of independent sample spectra are employed. A considerable improvement in measurement accuracy is possible with careful selection of estimator parameter values. Conclusions: Coherence measurement accuracy can be improved over previous applications by attention to estimator performance and accurate statistical testing of coherence estimates.

Further, we obtain the conditions under which the positive periodic solution is globally asymptotically stable. At last, we present two examples and numerical simulations.},
